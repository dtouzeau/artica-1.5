                               : added --with-web-url to configure script.

  * Makefile portability fixes : perl is now set to the installed perl location.
                               : added install-crontab to Makefile script
                                 if your OS supports this type of cron method.
                               : fixed 'sed' functions.
                               : added settings to Makefile script to examine
                                 configuration validity.

amavis-stats (0.1.13-rc6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a "-n" flag to allow classification limited to particular hosts.
    Uses a directories under /var/lib/amavis-stats and /var/cache/amavis-stats
    for each host. See man page for details.

  * Thanks to Wolfgang ?? fixed up SPAM detection that I broke in 0.1.12.

  * Handle extra fields (eg: [ID 23343 mail.info]) in Solaris 8 syslog.

  * Create rrd files as soon as a new ID is assigned. Prevents previous ugly
    behavour of php/rrdtool dying when called on IDs that had not yet been
    updated.

  * Fixed bug which produced different colours depending on the report period.

  * Added an option to automatically refresh web page

  * Now only display a single time-span (either daily, or weekly etc).
    It doesn't make sense to calculate and transfer a yearly image
    across the net everytime you want to view the latest 24-hour graph.

  * Forced generation of PNG graphics

  * When creating the RRDs, populate them with zeros starting at the beginning
    of the previous yearly "bin boundary", which is at a maximum 288 updates
    ago. This means that RRDs from previous versions are not producing
    accurate data. Unfortunately this means that this version should be
    installed "clean" (no history):

  * Graphs are produced only on rrdtool "bin boundaries". This means that they
    will be forced to have an end time which will be some multiple of the time
    span. Ie daily graphs must end on a five minute boundary, weekly graphs on
    a half-hour boundary etc. This together with the above RRD change should
    now mean that for the times specified the totals will be correct.

  * Thanks to Loic Pefferkorn a big php cleanup of global variables and
    errors.

  * Rewrote the classification function to account for amavisd-new-2004XXX
    changes. The names of the final classification IDs change, which also
    unfortunately breaks with old data. Re-install from scratch, *sigh*.

  * Added a search/replace for ":" in virus names so that rrdtool does not get
    confused.

  * Added RPM spec file from Andrew Koros.

  * Commented out use of %spamsess until we work out if it is needed or not.

  * Warn 5 times before exiting, if we can't correctly parse a line (unknown
    month errors).

  * test for directory when searching for multiple host statistics (reduces
    error messages)

amavis-stats (0.1.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Makefile portability fixes thanks to James Davis. perl is now set to to
    value of `which perl`

  * Thanks to Jean Charles Delepine don't count multiple occurences of a virus
    in the same email.

  * Fixed a column ordering bug in amavis-stats.php, and made a basic column
    calculation based on the length of the longest virus name.

  * Statistics are now based on the true final determination of AMaViS:
    Passed, Not-Delivered, INFECTED, BANNED, plus SPAM classifications of
    Passed and Not-Delivered.

  * Virus colours are now fixed per virus - generated by the md5sum of the
    virus name. This means that all installations of amavis-stats will have
    the same colours :-)

  * fixed bug (introduced in rc2) that didn't delete the session ids from the
    %spamsess hash.

  * Fixed issue with regex not matching properly for clamav virus checker.

amavis-stats (0.1.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * As per patch from Chris H, can now handle virus names with spaces in them.
    Unfortunately this breaks any amavis that separates multiple viruses by
    spaces, but that is broken anyway if the virus scanner reports virses
    names with spaces (which some do).

  * Added locale debugging statements. Add option to force locale detection
    (-l) otherwise English (and not "C") is assumed.

  * Added do_exit function to remove lockfile on error conditions.

  * amavis-ng virus detection thanks to Matthias L. Jugel.

  * Now using autoconf to install - ./configure; make; make install... etc.

  * Image directory has moved from /var/lib/amavis-stats/img to
    /var/cache/amavis-stats for FHS compliance.

  * Force images to be generated in PNG format. Graphs end at multiple of the
    rrd step value.

  * Limit updates to rrd files to be multiples of the "step" value. This
    should fix many of the "missing" single virus counts and other
    inaccuracies.

  * Fixed a configure bug on --with-group.

amavis-stats (0.1.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added contents of state/seen/virus definition files to the debug option of
    amavis-stats.php script.

  * amavis-stats now uses the locale/LANG envinronment to correctly read
    international date strings from syslog files. php script also prints out
    localized date/time strings.

  * php script now produces better error message when the rrdtool executable
    can't be found.

  * Fixed an issue were graphs could not be generated if no "Passed" emails
    had been seen.

  * TODO: Improve RPM build.

 -- Mark Lawrence <nomad@null.net>  Fri,  6 Feb 2004 14:54:16 +0000

amavis-stats (0.1.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Detects a "new" log entry of the form "amavisd-new[3823]:" which I have
    never seen before.

  * Fixed missing /usr/share/amavis-stats/img link (this has been bugging me
    for ages!)

  * Added "-V" option to display the version nuumber. Updated manpage.

  * amavis-stats: Converted perl regex's to be non-greedy. This should
    mean more accurate detection of virus names.

  * TODO: Improve RPM build.

 -- Mark Lawrence <nomad@null.net>  Thu, 27 Nov 2003 15:46:21 +0100

amavis-stats (0.1.8) unstable; urgency=low

amavis-stats (0.1.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * amavis-stats: Implemented a lock system to allow only one copy of
    amavis-stats to run at a time.

  * amavis-stats: The saveState() function now correctly saves the position
    we reached in the logfile. Was previously always recording the end of
    the file regardless of where we actually were.

  * Thanks to Pål Løberg now have support for counting BANNED messages.

  * amavis-stats: Correctly handle multiple viruses found in a single
    message. Now even get a nice "corrupted" virus count.

  * amavis-stats: Fixed a bug relating to reading lines that have not
    been fully output by syslog (ie missing newline at end of the file)

  * amavis-stats.php: Option to display rates per hour instead of rates per
    minute. Idea from Tom Spencer.

  * TODO: Fix up the RPM.

 -- Mark Lawrence <nomad@null.net>  Thu, 23 Oct 2003 09:56:51 +0200

    a single mail.

  * TODO: Locking in amavis-stats so that we can't run more than one at
    a time.

  * amavis-stats.php: Really, really fixed the command-line rrdtool 
    integration. It turns out that the php "exec" command doesn't collect
    stderr

  * amavis-stats.php: Added a "debug" option to the web page, to display the
    rrdtool command that generates each graph.

  * amavis-stats: Handles the new SPAM and SPAM-TAG format of amavis-new

 -- Mark Lawrence <nomad@null.net>  Thu, 16 Oct 2003 14:54:39 +0200

    from http://host/amavis-stats/ without having to copy the script
    into the web root.

  * Updated README for new installation.

 -- Mark Lawrence <nomad@null.net>  Tue,  7 Oct 2003 17:44:52 +0200

amavis-stats (0.1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * amavis-stats: Must now specify log file on the command line. "-f" no
    longer needed but kept for legacy reasons. Man page updated.

  * amavis-stats: "-v" now does nothing. Default is to output summary/
    interesting information. New option "-q" stops output.

  * amavis-stats: More robust logfile and rotation handling.

  * amavis-stats.php: rrdtool handling changes - if internal extentions are
    available use them, otherwise rely on an internal function and the
    command/shell "rrdtool" executable. Thanks to Daniel Huele.

  * First attempt at RPM package. Testers needed (hint, hint)

  * amavis-stats: Bugfix: Correctly ignore badly formed log lines (previously
    saw message like "use of uninitialized value in pattern match (m//)... ")

  * amavis-stats: Bugfix: If more than one virus was detected by amavis
    then we were actually recording that as a single virus called
    "virus1 virus2...". Now only count the first virus.

  * amavis-stats: Now save the current state every 1000 lines. More robust
    and means you can watch the graphs grow when running large files :)

  * debian: dependency now on rrdtool _or_ php4-rrdtool.

  * Much improved README file.

  * amavis-stats: Partial CLAMAV support thanks to Alan Murrell. Needs
    feedback (hint, hint). Does clamav really put a newline in the middle
    of a syslog entry when more than one part is infected?

  * TODO: Correctly handle the case where multiple viruses are found in
    a single mail.

  * TODO: Locking in amavis-stats so that we can't run more than one at
    a time.

  * TODO: create/include apache configuration to run the php script from
    /usr/share/amavis-stats without having to copy/modify files.

amavis-stats (0.1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * amavis-stats: Based on input from Lars Hecking, should now parse files
    from amavisd as well as amavisd-new.

  * amavis-stats: Based on input from Ricardo Stella should also now
    work on Solaris syslog files.

  * amavis-stats: Check for existence and writability of
    /var/lib/amavis-stats during loadStats().

  * amavis-stats: Added detection for SPAM (I think amavisd-new only) - Kai.

  * amavis-stats.php: Fixed a bug where script would die if zero detections
    had occurred. Support for SPAM detections.
