NAME
     amavisd-milter -- sendmail milter for amavisd-new

SYNOPSIS
     amavisd-milter [-fhv] [-d debug-level] [-D delivery-care-of]
		    [-m max-conns] [-M max-wait] [-p pidfile] [-q backlog]
		    [-s socket] [-t timeout] [-S socket] [-T timeout]
		    [-w directory]

DESCRIPTION
     The amavisd-milter is a sendmail milter (mail filter) for amavisd-new
     2.4.3 and above and sendmail 8.13 and above (limited support for 8.12 is
     provided).

     Instead of older amavis-milter helper program, full amavisd-new function-
     ality is available, including adding spam and virus information header
     fields, modifying Subject, adding address extensions and removing certain
     recipients from delivery while delivering the same message to the rest.

     For more informations you can visit amavisd-milter website:

	   http://amavisd-milter.sourceforge.net/

     and SourceForge project:

	   http://sourceforge.net/projects/amavisd-milter

   Options
     The options are as follows:

     -d debug-level
	     Set the debug level to debug-level.  Debugging traces become more
	     verbose as the debug level increases.  Maximum is 9.

     -D delivery-care-of
	     Set AM.PDP request attribute delivery_care_of to client (default)
	     or server.  When client method is used then amavisd-milter is
	     responsible to forward the message to recipients. This method
	     doesn't allow personalized header or body modification.

	     When server method is used then amavisd-new is responsible to
	     forward the message to recipients and can provide personalized
	     header and body modification.  $forward_method in amavisd.conf
	     must point to some place willing to accept mail without further
	     checking in amavisd-new.

     -f      Run amavisd-milter in the foreground (i.e. do not daemonize).
	     Print debug messages to the terminal.

     -h      Print help page and exit.

     -m max-conns
	     Maximum concurrent amavisd connections (default 0 - unlimited
	     number of connections).  It must agree with the $max_servers
	     entry in amavisd.conf.

     -M max-wait
	     Maximum wait for connection to amavisd in seconds (default 300 =
	     5 minutes).  It must be less then sending MTA timeout for a
	     response to the final "."	that terminates a message on sending
	     MTA.  sendmail has default value 1 hour, postfix 10 minutes and
	     qmail 20 minutes.	We suggest to use less than 10 minutes.

     -p pidfile
	     Use this pid file (default /var/amavis/amavisd-milter.pid).

     -q backlog
	     Sets the incoming socket backlog used by listen(2).  If it is not
	     set or set to zero, the operating system default is used.

     -s socket
	     Communication socket between sendmail and amavisd-milter (default
	     /var/amavis/amavisd-milter.sock).	The protocol spoken over this
	     socket is MILTER (Mail FILTER).  It must agree with the
	     INPUT_MAIL_FILTER entry in sendmail.mc

     -S socket
	     Communication socket between amavisd-milter and amavisd-new
	     (default /var/amavis/amavisd.sock).  The protocol spoken over
	     this socket is AM.PDP (AMavis Policy Delegation Protocol).  It
	     must agree with the $unix_socketname entry in amavisd.conf.

     -t timeout
	     sendmail connection timeout in seconds (default 600 = 10 min-
	     utes).  It must agree with the INPUT_MAIL_FILTER entry in send-
	     mail.mc and must be greater than or equal to the amavisd-new con-
	     nection timeout.  When you use other milters (especially time-
	     consuming), the timeout must be sufficient to process message in
	     all milters.

     -T timeout
	     amavisd-new connection timeout in seconds (default 600 = 10 min-
	     utes).  This timeout must be sufficient for message processing in
	     amavisd-new.  It's usually a good idea to adjust them to the same
	     value as sendmail connection timeout.

     -v      Report the version number and exit.

     -w directory
	     Set working directory (default /var/amavis).

   Limited support for sendmail 8.12
     o	 smfi_addheader() is used instead of smfi_insheader() for insheader
	 and addheader AM.PDP responses. This works well with amavisd-new
	 2.4.3 or newer.
     o	 smfi_progress() isn't called when amavisd-milter wait for amavisd-new
	 communication socket.
     o	 AM.PDP response quarantine isn't implemented.

FILES
     /var/amavis/amavisd-milter.pid
	     The default process-id file.

     /var/amavis/amavisd-milter.sock
	     The default sendmail communication socket.

     /var/amavis/amavisd.sock
	     Th default amavisd-new communication socket.

     /var/amavis
	     The default working directory.

POLICY BANK
     When remote client is authenticated, amavisd-milter forward this informa-
     tion to amavisd-new through AM.PDP request attribute policy_bank:

     SMTP_AUTH
	     Indicate that the remote client is authenticated.

     SMTP_AUTH_<MECH>
	     Remote client authentication mechanism.

     SMTP_AUTH_<MECH>_<BITS>
	     The number of bits used for the key of the symmetric cipher when
	     authentication mechanism use it.

EXAMPLES
   Configuring amavisd-new
     In amavisd.conf file change protocol and socket settings to:

	   $protocol = "AM.PDP";		      # Use AM.PDP protocol
	   $unix_socketname = "$MYHOME/amavisd.sock"; # Listen on Unix socket
	   ### $inet_socket_port = 10024;	      # Don't listen on TCP port

     Then (re)start amavisd daemon.

   Configuring sendmail
     To the sendmail.mc file add the following entries:

	   define(`confMILTER_MACROS_ENVFROM',
		   confMILTER_MACROS_ENVFROM`, r, b')
	   INPUT_MAIL_FILTER(`amavisd-milter',
		   `S=local:/var/amavis/amavisd-milter.sock,
		   F=T, T=S:10m;R:10m;E:10m')

     Then rebuild your sendmail.cf file, install it (usually to
     /etc/mail/sendmail.cf) and (re)start sendmail daemon.

   Running amavisd-milter
     This example assume that amavisd-new is running as user amavis.  It must
     agree with the entry $daemon_user in amavisd.conf.

     First create working directory:

	   mkdir /var/amavis/tmp
	   chmod 750 /var/amavis/tmp
	   chown amavis /var/amavis/tmp

     Then start amavisd-milter as non-priviledged user amavis:

	   su - amavis -c "amavisd-milter -w /var/amavis/tmp"

   Limiting maximum concurrent connections to amavisd
     To limit concurrent connections to 4 and fail after 10 minutes (10*60
     secs) of waiting run amavisd-milter with this options:

	   su - amavis -c "amavisd-milter -w /var/amavis/tmp -m 4 -M 600"

   Troubleshooting
     For troubleshooting run amavisd-milter on the foreground and set debug
     level to appropriate level:

	   su - amavis -c "amavisd-milter -w /var/amavis/tmp -f -d level"

     where debug levels are:

     1	   Not errors but unexpected states (connection abort etc).

     2	   Main states in message processing.

     3	   All amavisd-milter debug messages.

     4-9   Milter communication debugging (smfi_setdbg 1-6).
