(http://blog.taragana.com)
disable_vrfy_command = yes
SMTP protocol allows of using VRFY to verify the validity of an user in the server. Disabling VRFY takes one more facility which is abused by spammers.

strict_rfc821_envelopes = yes
The strict_rfc821_envelopes parameter controls how tolerant Postfix is with respect to addresses given in MAIL FROM or RCPT TO commands. Being strict to the RFC not only stops unwanted mail, it may also blocks legitimate mail from poorly-written mail applications. However I haven't found any false positive from this check. This appears to be safe in my experience.

smtpd_sender_restrictions = reject_non_fqdn_sender, reject_unknown_sender_domain
The smtpd_sender_restrictions parameter restricts what sender addresses this system accepts in MAIL FROM commands.

reject_non_fqdn_sender rejects the request when the address in the client MAIL FROM command is not in fully-qualified domain form.

reject_unknown_sender_domain rejects the request when the sender mail address has no DNS A or MX record. This check is essential to ensure that the email isn't sent from a fictitious domain name. You would be surprised at how many spammers use this lame trick.
