MIMEDefang is a framework for filtering e-mail.[br]
It uses Sendmail's "Milter" API, some C glue code, and some Perl code to let you write high-performance mail filters in Perl.[br]

People use MIMEDefang to:[ul]

[li]Block viruses[/li]
[li]Block or tag spam[/li]
[li]Remove HTML mail parts[/li]
[li]Add boilerplate disclaimers to outgoing mail[/li]
[li]Remove or alter attachments[/li]
[li]Replace attachments with URL's[/li]
[li]Implement sophisticated access controls.[/li]

A "forward zone" is a way to configure forwarding on a per-domain basis.[br]
A zone statement of type forward can contain a forward and/or forwarders statement,
which will apply to queries within the domain given by the zone name.[br]
If no forwarders statement is present or an empty list for forwarders is given, then no forwarding will be done for the domain,
canceling the effects of any forwarders in the options statement.[br]
Thus if you want to use this type of zone to change the behavior of the global forward option
(that is, "forward first to", then "forward only", or vice versa, but want to use the same servers as set globally) you need to respecify the global forwarders.

The initial set of root nameservers is specified using a "hint zone".[br]

They will begin to be processed once Postfix is started.
The "maildrop" queue is drained by the single threaded pickup service scanning the queue directory periodically or when notified of new message arrival by the postdrop program.[br]
The postdrop program is a setgid helper that allows the unprivileged Postfix sendmail program to inject mail into the "maildrop" queue and to notify the pickup(8) service of its arrival.[br]
All mail that enters the main Postfix queue does so via the cleanup service.[br] The cleanup service is responsible for envelope and header rewriting, header and body regular expression checks, automatic bcc recipient processing, milter content processing, and reliable insertion of the message into the Postfix "incoming" queue.

Discrimination behaviour is enabled by the 'discrimination' configuration variable in sqlgrey.conf
[br]
[H5]Default[/H5]

By default discrimination is set to 'off'. [br]
SQLgrey will apply greylisting (with the default whitelisting and auto-whitelisting described in the HOWTO) to every message.[br]
By default 'discrimination add rule number' is 'off'.[br]
If set to on, the greylist reply to the client will have the rule number added to the end  of the rejection text. (eg. 'Greylisted for 5 minutes (2)').
[br]
[H5]Discrimination[/H5]
Discrimination based greylisting is only usefull if you DO NOT want to greylist everybody.
[br]There may be several reasons for this.[br]
For example it can be used as a soft transistion to start greylisting, slowly  over time  making it more and more restrictive. [br]
Or it can help you convince management to allow you to do greylisting by explaining that you'd only greylist "anything suspicous" and thus, not your own  customers.
[br]

[H5]Discrimination - what is it?[/H5]

This feature was pretty hard to find a name for, but discrimination describes pretty well what it does. It discriminates ;).

I think of it as "the airport principle".[br] Everybody is let onto the plane UNLESS they find you suspicous.
You might have long hair,wear a turban, have dark skin or simply wearing a t-shirt saying  "explosive" or "GNU rocks".
[br]Then you will, by discrimination, be held back for further analysis. (im not saying it fair, its just a very good example)
[br]
The same principle applies here.
[br]Everyone is whitelisted UNLESS they look suspicous.[br]
If so, they have to go through greylisting.[br]
What is suspicous is defined in the discrimination.regexp file.[br]
In here one defines regular expression that will be used to check different attributes.[br]
[br][br]
Example:[br]
sender =~ @microsoft.com$
[br][br]
This line simply defines, that if the senders address ends on microsoft.com, its suspicous and thus will be greylisted.[br]
[br][br]
Another example:[br]
sender !~ ^(god|allah|jesus)@heaven.com$[br]
[br][br]
Note the !~ which means "anything that does NOT match, is suspicous".[br]
In this particular example we say: "We trust god, allah or jesus sending from heaven.com, but EVERYONE else will be greylisted."[br]

[br]
[H5]Rule Details[/H5]
The rules in /discrimination.regexp are defines by the following triplet:
[br]
[br]attribute comparison-operator regex[br]
[br]Valid comparison operators are:[br]
[br]=~ 	Equal to
[br]!~	Not Equal to
[br]
Valid attributes are anyhing sent from postfix to the policy deamon,but the ill explain the most common (and usefull) here:
[ul]
[li]sender		= the From address (from MAIL FROM:)[/li]
[li]recipient	= the recipients mail address (from RCPT TO:)[/li]
[li]client_address	= IP address of the client[/li]
[li]client_name	= Reverse-dns name of the client[/li]
[li]helo_name	= The text entered as "helo text"[/li]
[/ul]
[br]
Valid regular expression are simply perl compatable regular expressions.[br]
(without the "/" in beginning and end).[br]
[br]
[H5]Configuration directive: discrimination add rule number[/H5]

enable adds the rule number of the rule that caused the greylisting to the end of the rejection text, like this:[br]
 [i]Greylisted for 5 minutes (2)[/i][br]
In this case, 2 means the second (valid) regular expression in the file,caused the greylisting.[br]
This feature is to allow the support department to help customers figure out why, if their mail gets greylisted.[br]

[br]
[H5]Rule tips[/H5]
Its hard to define what is worthy of another look, and its definently not a 100% solution. [br]
If you have the guts and/or oppotunity, you should go with normal greylisting.[br]
I look often at our maillog and by doing so, start to see patterns to what spam looks like.
[br]You should do the same to find out whats good for greylisting, but some general tips are:[br]
[ul]
[li]missing reverse-dns[/li]
[li]mails from microsoft, fbi, paypal, ebay and the likes[/li]
[li]NULL senders. (blank sender address)[/li]
[li]mailaddresses with special chars (eg. $ or *)[/li]
[/ul][br]
The first one takes alot of the trash. So does NULL senders, but be advised that NULL senders are also legaly used in bounce mails.[br]
[br]
[H5]Performance guidelines[/H5]

It doesnt take much to do this check if you keep your list of expressions within reasonable limits.
[br]Actually this feature should be a performance saver, as it takes away a bunch of sql load, depending on how much you discriminate.[br]
[br]
This function is being used in a real-life scenario with ~100.000 accounts being checked by 10 regular expressions.[br]
There is no measurable perfomance loss.[br]

SQLgrey behaviour depends on the 'optmethod' configuration variable in sqlgrey.conf
By default Optin/Optout is set to 'none'.[br]
SQLgrey will apply greylisting (with the default whitelisting and auto-whitelisting described in the HOWTO) to every message.
[br]

If Optin/Optout is set to either 'optin' or 'optout', SQLgrey will check four tables to decide if the greylisting must be used.[br]
These four tables are:
[ul]
[li]optin_domain[/li]
[li]optin_email[/li]
[li]optout_domain[/li]
[li]optout_email[/li]
[/ul]

They each have only one column with either a domain name or a full email address (stored as a VARCHAR(255)).
[br]
[br][i][b]the content of each of these table *MUST* be *lowercased*.[br] SQLgrey always use lowercased address internally and for
performance reasons won't ask the database to check for different cases.[/b][/i]
[br]
If 'optin' is used, SQLgrey will only greylist in two cases:
[ul]
[li]the domain is in optin_domain AND the address isn't in optout_email,[/li]
[li]the address is in optin_email.[/li]
[/ul]
[br]
If 'optout' is used, SQLgrey won't greylist in two cases:
[ul]
[li]the domain is in optout_domain AND the address isn't in optin_email,[/li]
[li]the address is in optout_email.[/li]
[/ul]
[br]
[b][i]
SQLgrey doesn't check if the 4 tables' content is consistent. [br]
For example you should make sure that an address isn't both in optin_email and optout_email which doesn't make sense (SQLgrey won't crash but its
behaviour can change between versions).[/i]

[H5]Performance guidelines[/H5]
For maximum performance, you should use the method which will use the least table entries.[br]
If nearly all your users want greylisting, you'll have better performance with 'optout'. If all of them want it without exception, use 'none'.[br]

If the needs of your users change between domains, use one of the optin/out_domain tables to set defaults (depending on the optmethod) by domain and add exceptions in the optin/out_email tables. This will
lower the number of entries in the database and help with performance.
[br]
[br][H5]Long email addresses[/H5]

For portability, addresses are limited to 255 characters. If you have users with addresses of more than 255 characters,
you'll have to trim the addresses the same way SQLgrey does: simply take the 255 first characters of the address leaving the rest out.[br]
If you have several users with the same 255 first characters, then it won't work properly (obviously the last user modified will set the
behaviour for the group beginning with the same characters).[br] As addresses of this size are pretty uncommon, the risk of collisions is probably only theoric though.

Try to avoid temporary tables by optimizing the queries where possible,

Watching the processlist for queries with temporary tables that take too long to resolve can give you an early warning that 
tmp table size needs to be upped.[br]
Be aware that memory is also allocated per-thread.[br]
An example where upping this worked for more was a server where upped this from 32MB (the default) to 64MB with immediate effect.[br]
The quicker resolution of queries resulted in less threads being active at any one time, with all-round benefits for the server, and available memory.

 Sets the size of the shared memory buffer pool — that is, the cache.[br]
 The cache should be the size of the normal working data set of the application, 
 with some small amount of additional memory for unusual situations.[br]
 (Note: the working set is not the same as the number of pages accessed simultaneously, and is usually 
 much larger.)[br]
The value specified for this parameter is the maximum value that your application will be able to use for your in-memory cache. If your application does not have enough data to fill up the amount of space specified here, then your application will only use the amount of memory required by the data that your application does have.
For the DB, the default cache size is 8MB.[br]
You cannot specify a cache size value of less than 100KB.[br]
Any cache size less than 500MB is automatically increased by 25% to account for cache overhead;
 cache sizes larger than 500MB are used as specified.[br]
 The maximum size of a single cache is 4GB on 32-bit systems and 10TB on 64-bit systems.[br]
 (All sizes are in powers-of-two, that is, 256KB is 2^18 not 256,000.)[br]
It is possible to specify cache sizes large enough they cannot be allocated contiguously on some architectures.[br]
 For example, some releases of Solaris limit the amount of memory that may be allocated contiguously by a 
 process.[br]
If ncache is 0 or 1, the cache will be allocated contiguously in memory.[br]
If it is greater than 1, the cache will be split across ncache separate regions, where the region size 
is equal to the initial cache size divided by ncache.[br]
The cache size supplied to this parameter will be rounded to the nearest multiple of the region size and 
may not be larger than the maximum possible cache size configured for your application 
(use the set_cache_max to do this).[br]
The ncache parameter is ignored when resizing the cache.
The syntax of this parameter is a single line with the string one or more whitespace characters, 
and the initial cache size specified in three parts: the gigabytes of cache, the additional bytes of cache,and the number of caches, also separated by whitespace characters.

";s:13:"domain master";s:13:"domain master";s:18:"domain master_text";s:1597:"
Tell samba to enable WAN-wide browse list collation.[br]
Setting this option causes server to claim a special domain specific NetBIOS name that  identifies it as a domain master browser for its given workgroup.[br]
Local master browsers in the same workgroup on broadcast-isolated subnets will give this server their local browse lists, and then ask shared server
for a complete copy of the browse list for the  whole wide area network.
[br]Browser clients will then contact their local master browser, and will receive the domain-wide browse list, instead of just the list for their broadcast-isolated subnet.[br]
Note that Windows NT Primary Domain Controllers expect to be able to claim this workgroup specific special NetBIOS name that identifies
them as domain master browsers for that workgroup by default (i.e. there is no way to prevent a Windows NT PDC from attempting to do this).[br]
This means that if this parameter is set and this server claims the special name for a workgroup before a Windows NT PDC is able to do so then cross subnet browsing
will behave strangely and may fail.[br]
If  domain  logons  =  yes,  then  the default behavior is to enable the domain master parameter.[br]
If domain logons is not enabled (the default setting), then neither will domain master be enabled by default.[br]
When domain logons = Yes the default setting for this parameter is Yes, with the result that Samba will be a PDC.[br]
If domain  master  = No, Samba will function as a BDC.[br]
In general, this parameter should be set to ’No’ only on a BDC. [br]

Bogofilter is a mail filter that classifies mail as spam or ham (non-spam) by a statistical analysis of the message's header and content (body).[br]
The program is able to learn from the user's classifications and corrections.[br]
The statistical technique is known as the Bayesian technique and its use for spam.[br]
Bogofilter will create a words database for each internal user.[br]
To classify messages as ham (non-spam) or spam, bogofilter needs to learn from your users mails[br]
In this case you need to create 2 robots users.[br][br]

A Universal Resource Identifier (URI) is a standard means of addressing resources on the Web.[br]
Common URIs such as Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) and Uniform Resource Names (URNs) are used to identify the destination of hypertext links as well as the sources of images,
information and other objects in a Web Page. [br]
URLs are most generally used in web sites but can also be included as part of an email message body e.g. to attract new visitors to a web site.[br]

SURBLs differ from most other RBLs in that they are used to detect spam based on message body URIs.[br]
Unlike most other RBLs, SURBLs are not used to block spam senders.[br] Instead they allow you to block messages that have spam hosts (e.g. web servers, domains, web sites) which are mentioned in message bodies. [br]
This module use pourcent method to judge if a mail is sended by a black web or spamer computer.[br]
In the table below, you must reach 1OO% with a list of surbl servers database.[br]to increase the detection rate, you may exceed 100% of results[br]For example you can set[br]
[ul]
[li]rhsbl.ahbl.org as 20%[/li]
[li]multi.surbl.org as 30%[/li]

Here's an overview of how it works.[br]
When a bounce is received, Mailman tries to extract two pieces of information from the message: the address of the member the message was intended for, and the severity of
the problem causing the bounce. The severity can be either hard or soft meaning either a fatal error occurred, or a transient error occurred.[br]
When in doubt, a hard severity is used.
If no member address can be extracted from the bounce, then the bounce is usually discarded.[br]
Otherwise, each member is assigned a bounce score and every time we encounter a bounce from this member we increment the score.[br]
Hard bounces increment by 1 while soft bounces increment by 0.5.[br]
We only increment the bounce score once per day, so even if we receive ten hard bounces from a member per day, their score will increase by only 1 for that day.[br]
When a member's bounce score is greater than the bounce score threshold, the subscription is disabled.[br]
Once disabled, the member will not receive any postings from the list until their membership is explicitly re-enabled (either by the list administrator or the user).
[br]However, they will receive occasional reminders that their membership has been disabled, and these reminders will include information about how to re-enable their membership.[br]
You can control both the number of reminders the member will receive and the frequency with which these reminders are sent.[br]
There is one other important configuration variable;[br] after a certain period of time -- during which no bounces from the member are received -- the bounce information is considered stale and discarded.
[br]Thus by adjusting this value, and the score threshold, you can control how quickly bouncing members are disabled.
[br]You should tune both of these to the frequency and traffic volume of your list";s:22:"bounce_processing_text";s:249:"Should Mailman perform automatic bounce processing?[br]

This value can be a floating point number.[br]
Each subscriber is assigned a bounce score, as a floating point number.[br]
Whenever Mailman receives a bounce from a list member, that member's score is incremented.[br]
Hard bounces (fatal errors) increase the score by 1, while soft bounces (temporary errors) increase the score by 0.5.[br]
Only one bounce per day counts against a member's score, so even if 10 bounces are received for a member on the same day, their score will increase by just 1.[br]

1) If this really is a permanent bounce from one of your members, you should probably manually remove them from your list, and
[br]2) you might want to send the message on to the Mailman developers so that this new format can be added to its known set.[br]
If you really can't be bothered, then set this variable to No and all non-detected bounces will be discarded without further processing.[br]
Note: This setting will also affect all messages sent to your list's -admin address.[br]
This address is deprecated and should never be used, but some people may still send mail to this address.[br]

Policies concerning the content of list traffic.[br]
Content filtering works like this: when a message is received by the list and you have enabled content filtering, the individual attachments are first compared to the filter types.
[br]If the attachment type matches an entry in the filter types, it is discarded.
[br]Then, if there are pass types defined, any attachment type that does not match a pass type is also discarded.
[br]If there are no pass types defined, this check is skipped.
[br]After this initial filtering, any multipart attachments that are empty are removed.
[br]If the outer message is left empty after this filtering, then the whole message is discarded.
[br]Then, each multipart/alternative section will be replaced by just the first alternative that is non-empty after filtering if collapse_alternatives is enabled.
[br]Finally, any text/html parts that are left in the message may be converted to text/plain if convert_html_to_plaintext is enabled and the site is configured to allow these conversions.

When the moderation flag is turned on, list member postings must be approved first.[br]
You, the list administrator can decide whether a specific individual's postings will be moderated or not.[br]
When a new member is subscribed, their initial moderation flag takes its value from this option.[br]

Trusted in this case means that relay hosts on these networks are considered to not be potentially operated by spammers,
open relays, or open proxies.

A trusted host could conceivably relay spam, but will not originate it, and will not forge header data.[br]
DNS blacklist checks will never query for hosts on these networks.[br]
MXes for your domain(s) and internal relays should also be specified using the internal networks setting.[br]
When there are 'trusted' hosts that are not MXes or internal relays for your domain(s) they should only be specified in trusted networks.[br]
If a /mask is specified, it's considered a CIDR-style 'netmask', specified in bits.[br]
If it is not specified, but less than 4 octets are specified with a trailing dot, that's considered a mask to allow
all addresses in the remaining octets.[br]
If a mask is not specified, and there is not trailing dot, then just the single IP address specified is used, as if the mask was /32.

The auto-whitelist, aka automatic whitelist or AWL, tracks scores for your regular correspondents in a small on-disk database.[br]
In 3.1, it is a plugin, loaded by default in the file v310.pre.[br]
The AWL is actually a very simple system.[BR]
In short, the AWL is a score averaging system.[BR]
It keeps track of the historical average of a sender, and pushes any subsequent mail towards that average.[br]
So if someone that never sent you mail before sends you a mail that scores 20, and then sends you a second mail that would score 2.0 without the AWL,
the AWL will push the score up to 11 on the second mail.[br]
This is auto blacklisting, based on their past history of spam.[br]
If that same person sent you a mail that scored 0, and then later sent one that scored 7,
the AWL would push the score down to 3.5.[br]
This is auto-whitelisting based on past history of nonspam.[br]
A "sender" is identified using both the address they sent with, and their IP address, so spam claiming to be From you with forged headers will fail to get through.[br]
But the "auto whitelist" isn't really a whitelist per-se. [br]
It does however have a "learning white/blacklist" type behavior as a result of its averaging.[br]
Sometimes it may appear that the AWL is assigning scores the wrong way;

j-chkmail implements greylisting method from Evan Harris.
j-chkmail implementation is intended to be used on huge servers.[br]
So, it tries to reduce the number of entries on database,
and uses results from other filtering methods to remove unwanted entries.[br]
Other than original databases (pending and validated entries),
j-chkmail uses two new databases : whitelisted entries and blacklisted entries.
Whitelisted entries database contains only couples of IP and domain names.

";s:21:"samba_strict_allocate";s:32:"Windows behaviour storage blocks";s:26:"samba_strict_allocate_text";s:1517:"controls the handling of disk space allocation in the server.[br]
When this is set the server will change from UNIX behaviour of not committing real disk storage blocks when a file 
is extended to the Windows behaviour of actually forcing the disk system to allocate real storage blocks when a file
 is created or extended to be a given size.[br]
In UNIX terminology this means that Samba will stop creating sparse files.[br]
This can be slow on some systems.[br]
When you work with large files like >100MB or so you may even run into problems with clients running into timeouts.[br]
When you have an extent based filesystem it's likely that we can make use of unwritten extents which allows Samba
 to allocate even large amounts of space very fast and you will not see any timeout problems caused by strict allocate.[br]
 With strict allocate in use you will also get much better out of quota messages in case you use quotas.[br]
 Another advantage of activating this setting is that it will help to reduce file fragmentation.[br]
To give you an idea on which filesystems this setting might currently be a good option for you: XFS, ext4, btrfs, ocfs2 on Linux and JFS2 on AIX support unwritten extents.[br]
On Filesystems that do not support it, preallocation is probably an expensive operation where you will 
see reduced performance and risk to let clients run into timeouts when creating large files.[br]
Examples are ext3, ZFS, HFS+ and most others, so be aware if you activate this setting on those filesystems
";s:21:"samba_virtual_explain";s:751:"Virtual servers are a technique for creating the illusion of multiple NetBIOS servers on the network,
when in reality there is only one.[br]
The technique is simple to implement: a machine simply registers more than one NetBIOS name in association with its IP address.[br]
There are tangible benefits to doing this.[br]
The accounting department, for example, might have an accounting server, and clients of it would see just the accounting disks and printers. The marketing department could have their own server, marketing, with their own reports, and so on. However,
 all the services would be provided by one medium-sized Unix workstation (and one relaxed administrator),
  instead of having one small server and one administrator per department.
";s:18:"samba_wins_explain";s:657:"broadcasting - whether it be browsing or name registration and resolution - does not pass easily across 
multiple subnets.[br]
In addition, many broadcasts tend to bog down networks.[br]
To solve this problem, Microsoft now provides the Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS),
 a cross-subnet NBNS, which Samba supports.[br]
 With it, an administrator can designate a single machine to act as a WINS server,
 and can then provide each client that requires name resolution the address of the WINS server.[br]
 Consequently, name registration and resolution requests can be directed to a single machine from any point on the network, 
 instead of broadcast.

 After that the child process terminates and the main daemon provides a new child process to take its place.[br]

Crossroads is a load balance and fail over utility for TCP based services.[br]
It is a daemon program running in user space, and features extensive configurability, polling of back ends using 'wakeup calls',
detailed status reporting, 'hooks' for special actions when backend calls fail, and much more.[br]
Crossroads is service-independent: it is usable for HTTP/HTTPS, SSH, SMTP, DNS, etc. [br]
In the case of HTTP balancing, Crossroads can modify HTTP headers, e.g. to provide 'session stickiness' for back end processes
that need sessions, but aren't session-aware of other back ends

If a Windows client doesn't have permissions to delete a file then they expect this to be denied at open time.[br]
POSIX systems normally only detect restrictions on delete by actually attempting to delete the file or directory.[br]
As Windows clients can (and do) "back out" a delete request by unsetting the "delete on close" bit Samba cannot delete the file immediately on "open for delete" request as we cannot restore such a deleted file.[br]
With this parameter set (the default) then Samba checks the file system permissions directly on "open for delete" and denies the request without
actually deleting the file if the file system permissions would seem to deny it.[br]
This is not perfect, as it's possible a user could have deleted a file without Samba being able to check the permissions correctly,
but it is close enough to Windows semantics for mostly correct behaviour.[br]
Samba will correctly check POSIX ACL semantics in this case.[br]
If this parameter is set to "false" Samba doesn't check permissions on "open for delete" and allows the open.[br]
If the user doesn't have permission to delete the file this will only be discovered at close time, which is

Internet Domain Name Service in a particular format.[br]
DNSBLs are most often used to publish the addresses of computers or networks linked to spamming;
 most mail server software can be configured to reject or flag messages which have been sent from a site listed on one or more such lists.[br]
"DNSBL" is a software mechanism, rather than a specific list or policy.[br]
There are dozens of DNSBLs in existence,[1][2] which use a wide array of standards for listing and delisting of addresses.[br]
These may include listing the addresses of zombie computers or other machines being used to send spam, listing the addresses of ISPs who willingly host spammers, or listing addresses which have sent spam to a honeypot system.[br]
Since the creation of the first DNSBL in 1997, the operation and policies of these lists have been frequently controversial, both in Internet advocacy and occasionally in lawsuits. Many mail system operators and users consider DNSBLs a valuable tool to share information about spam sources, but others including prominent Internet activists have objected to them as a form of censorship. In addition, a small number of DNSBL operators have been the target of lawsuits filed by spammers seeking to have the lists shut down.

Fetchmail is not a toy or a coder's learning exercise, but an industrial-strength tool capable of transparently handling every retrieval demand from those of a simple single-user ISP connection up to mail retrieval and rerouting for an entire client domain.[br]
Fetchmail is easy to configure, unobtrusive in operation, powerful, feature-rich, and well documented.[br]
Fetchmail is open-source software.[br] The openness of the sources is the strongest assurance of quality you can have.[br]

The network interface addresses that this mail system receives mail on.[br]
Specify "all" to receive mail on all network interfaces (default), and "loopback-only" to receive mail on loopback network interfaces only 
(Postfix version 2.2 and later). [br]
The parameter also controls delivery of mail to user@[ip.address].[br]

    [i]Note 1: you need to stop and start Postfix when this parameter changes.[/i][br]

    [i]Note 2: address information may be enclosed inside [], but this form is not required here.[/i]

    [br]
    When inet_interfaces specifies just one IPv4 and/or IPv6 address that is not a loopback address,
     the Postfix SMTP client will use this address as the IP source address for outbound mail.[br]
     Support for IPv6 is available in Postfix version 2.2 and later.[br]

    On a multi-homed firewall with separate Postfix instances listening on the "inside" and "outside" interfaces,
    this can prevent each instance from being able to reach servers on the "other side" of the firewall.
    [br]A better solution for multi-homed firewalls is to leave inet_interfaces at the default value and instead use explicit IP addresses in the master.cf[br]
    SMTP server definitions.
    [br]This preserves the Postfix SMTP client's loop detection, by ensuring that each side of the firewall knows that 
    the other IP address is still the same host.[br]
     Setting $inet_interfaces to a single IPv4 and/or IPV6 address is primarily useful with virtual hosting of domains on secondary IP addresses,
     when each IP address serves a different domain (and has a different $myhostname setting).[br]

Fetchmail is a one-stop solution to the remote mail retrieval problem for Unix machines, quite useful to anyone with an intermittent PPP or SLIP connection to a remote mailserver. It can collect mail using any variant of POP or IMAP and forwards via port 25 to the local SMTP listener, enabling all the normal forwarding/filtering/aliasing mechanisms that would apply to local mail or mail arriving via a full-time TCP/IP connection.

Fetchmail is not a toy or a coder's learning exercise, but an industrial-strength tool capable of transparently handling every retrieval demand from those of a simple single-user ISP connection up to mail retrieval and rerouting for an entire client domain. Fetchmail is easy to configure, unobtrusive in operation, powerful, feature-rich, and well documented.

Fetchmail is open-source software. The openness of the sources is the strongest assurance of quality you can have. Extensive peer review by a large, multi-platform user community has shown that fetchmail is as near bulletproof as the underlying protocols permit.

    This is the list of domains that are delivered via the mail delivery transport.[br]
     By default this is the Postfix local delivery agent which looks up all recipients.[br]

    [br] On a mail domain gateway, you should also include $mydomain.
";s:19:"mydestination_title";s:34:"What domains to receive mail for ?";s:15:"myhostname_text";s:839:"
This parameter specifies the fully-qualified domain name of the machine running the Postfix system.[br] $myhostname appears as the default value in many other Postfix configuration parameters.[br]

By default, myhostname is set to the local machine name.[br] If your local machine name is not in fully-qualified domain name form, or if you run Postfix on a virtual interface, you will have to specify the fully-qualified domain name that the mail system should use.
[br]
Alternatively, if you specify mydomain in main.cf, then Postfix will use its value to generate a fully-qualified default value for the myhostname parameter.[br]
Examples (specify only one of the following):
[ul]
[li]host.local.domain (machine name is not FQDN)[/li]		
[li]host.virtual.domain (virtual interface)[/li]
[li]virtual.domain (virtual interface)[/li]

The default is to authorize all clients in the IP subnetworks that the local machine is attached to.[br]

Examples:[ul]

With SMTP connection caching, Postfix can deliver multiple messages over the same SMTP connection[br]
SMTP Connection caching is a performance feature.[br]
Whether or not it actually improves performance depends on the conditions
[ul]
[li]SMTP Connection caching can greatly improve performance when delivering mail to a destination with multiple mail servers, because it can help Postfix to skip over a non-responding server.[/li]
[li]Otherwise, the benefits of SMTP connection caching are minor: it eliminates the latency of the TCP handshake (SYN, SYN+ACK, ACK), plus the latency of the SMTP initial handshake (220 greeting, EHLO command, EHLO response).[/li]
[li]SMTP Connection caching gives no gains with respect to SMTP session tear-down. The Postfix sender process normally does not wait for the server's reply to the QUIT command, and it never waits for the TCP final handshake to complete.[/li]
[li]SMTP Connection caching introduces some overhead: the client needs to send an RSET command to find out if a connection is still usable, before it can send the next MAIL FROM command[/li]
[/ul]
 When SMTP connection caching is enabled, the sending process does not disconnect after a mail transaction, but gives the connection to the scache 
 server which keeps the connection open for a limited amount of time.[br]
After handing over the open connection to the scache server, the sender process continues with some other mail delivery request.[br]
Meanwhile, any sender process can ask the scache server for that cached connection and reuse it for mail delivery.[br]
The connection cache can be searched by destination domain name and by the IP address of the host at the other end of the connection.[br]
This allows Postfix to reuse a connection even when the remote host is mail server for domains with different names. 
[h4] The Postfix sender process supports two connection caching strategies[/h4]
[ul]
[li][strong]On-demand connection caching.[/strong]
 This is enabled by default.[br]
 When this feature is enabled, the Postfix sender process automatically saves a connection to the connection cache when a destination has a high volume of mail in the active queue. 
[br][/li]
[li][strong]Per-destination connection caching.[/strong][br]
This is enabled by explicitly listing specific destinations.[br]
After completing delivery to a selected destination, the Postfix sender process [i]always[/i] saves the connection to the connection cache
[/li]
[/ul]

The timer starts when the connection is initiated (i.e. it includes the connect, greeting and helo latency, in addition to the latencies of subsequent mail delivery transactions).[br]
This feature addresses a performance stability problem with remote SMTP servers.
[br]This problem is not specific to Postfix: [i]it can happen when any MTA sends large amounts of SMTP email to a site that has multiple MX hosts.[/i][br]
The problem starts when one of a set of MX hosts becomes slower than the rest.[br]
Even though SMTP clients connect to fast and slow MX hosts with equal probability, the slow MX host ends up with more simultaneous inbound connections than the faster MX hosts, 
because the slow MX host needs more time to serve each client request.[br]
[strong]The slow MX host becomes a connection attractor.[/strong]If one MX host becomes N times slower than the rest, it dominates mail delivery 
latency unless there are more than N fast MX hosts to counter the effect.[br]
And if the number of MX hosts is smaller than N, the mail delivery latency becomes effectively that of the slowest MX host divided by the total number of MX hosts.[br]
The solution uses connection caching by limiting the amount of time during which a connection can be used repeatedly (instead of limiting the number of deliveries over that connection),
 Postfix not only restores fairness in the distribution of simultaneous connections across a set of MX hosts, it also favors deliveries over connections 
 that perform well, which is exactly what we want.[br]
The default reuse time limit, [code]300s[/code], is comparable to the various smtp transaction timeouts which are fair estimates of maximum excess 
latency for a slow delivery.[br][i]Note that hosts may accept thousands of messages over a single connection within the default connection reuse time limit.[/i][br]
This number is much larger than the limit of 10 messages per cached connection.[br]
it may prove necessary to lower the limit to avoid interoperability issues with MTAs that exhibit bugs when many messages are delivered via a single connection.
[br]A lower reuse time limit risks losing the benefit of connection reuse when the average connection and mail delivery latency exceeds the reuse time limit.

 When a Postfix delivery agent (smtp(8), local(8), etc.) is unable to deliver a message it may blame the message itself, or it may blame the receiving party.[br]
 [ul]
[li]When the delivery agent blames the message, the queue manager gives the queue file a time stamp into the future, 
so it won't be looked at for a while.[br]
By default, the amount of time to cool down is the amount of time that has passed since the message arrived.[br]
This results in so-called exponential backoff behavior.[/li]
[li]When the delivery agent blames the receiving party (for example a local recipient user, or a remote host), 
the queue manager not only advances the queue file time stamp, but also puts the receiving party on a "dead" list so that it will be skipped for some amount of time.[/li]

[/ul]
[i]IMPORTANT: If you increase the frequency of deferred mail delivery attempts, or if you flush the deferred mail queue frequently,
 then you may find that Postfix mail delivery performance actually becomes worse.[/i][br]
 [strong]The symptoms are as follows:[/strong]
 [ul]
[li]The active queue becomes saturated with mail that has delivery problems. New mail enters the active queue only when an old message is deferred.
[br] This is a slow process that usually requires timing out one or more SMTP connections.[/li]
[li]All available Postfix delivery agents become occupied trying to connect to unreachable sites etc.[br]
New mail has to wait until a delivery agent becomes available.[br]
 This is a slow process that usually requires timing out one or more SMTP connections.[/li]
[/ul]When mail is being deferred frequently, fixing the problem is always better than increasing the frequency of delivery attempts.
[br] However, if you can control only the delivery attempt frequency, consider using a dedicated fallback_relay "graveyard" machine for bad destinations,
 so that these destinations do not ruin the performance of normal mail deliveries.

";s:22:"title_postfix_tuning_7";s:38:"Tuning the number of Postfix processes";s:27:"title_postfix_tuning_7_text";s:418:"The "default process limit" configuration parameter gives direct control over how many daemon processes Postfix will run.[br]
As of Postfix 2.0 the default limit is 100 smtp client processes, 100 smtp server processes, and so on.[br]
This may overwhelm systems with little memory, as well as networks with low bandwidth.[br]
You can change the global process limit by specifying a non-default "default process limit".
";s:22:"title_postfix_tuning_8";s:44:"Tuning the number of simultaneous deliveries";s:27:"title_postfix_tuning_8_text";s:4495:"
 Although Postfix can be configured to run 1000 SMTP client processes at the same time, it is rarely desirable that it makes 
 1000 simultaneous connections to the same remote system.[br]
 For this reason, Postfix has safety mechanisms in place to avoid this so-called "thundering herd" problem.[br]
The Postfix queue manager implements the analog of the TCP slow start flow control strategy:
[i]when delivering to a site, send a small number of messages first, then increase the concurrency as long as all goes well; reduce concurrency in the face of congestion.[/i][br]
[ul]The [strong]"initial destination concurrency"[/strong] parameter (default: 5) controls how many messages are initially sent to the same destination before adapting 
delivery concurrency.[br]
Of course, this setting is effective only as long as it does not exceed the process limit and the destination concurrency limit for the specific mail transport channel.[/li]
[li]The [strong]"default destination concurrency limit"[/strong] parameter (default: 20) controls how many messages may be sent to the same destination simultaneously.[br]
 You can override this setting for specific message delivery transports by taking the name of the master.cf entry and appending "_destination_concurrency_limit".[br]
[/ul]
Examples of transport specific concurrency limits are:
[ul]
[li]The [strong]"local destination concurrency limit"[/strong] parameter (default: 2) controls how many messages are delivered simultaneously to the same local recipient.
[br]The recommended limit is low because delivery to the same mailbox must happen sequentially, so massive parallelism is not useful.[br]
Another good reason to limit delivery concurrency to the same recipient:[br] if the recipient has an expensive shell command in her .forward file, 
or if the recipient is a mailing list manager, you don't want to run too many instances of those processes at the same time.[/li]
[li]The default [strong]"smtp destination concurrency limit"[/strong] of 20 seems enough to noticeably load a system without bringing it to its knees.[br]
Be careful when changing this to a much larger number.[/li][/ul]
The above default values of the concurrency limits work well in a broad range of situations.[br]
Knee-jerk changes to these parameters in the face of congestion can actually make problems worse.[br]
Specifically, large destination concurrencies should never be the default.[br]
They should be used only for transports that deliver mail to a small number of high volume domains.[br]
A common situation where high concurrency is called for is on gateways relaying a high volume of mail from between the Internet and an intranet mail environment.[br]
Approximately half the mail (assuming equal volumes inbound and outbound) will be destined for the internal mail hubs.[br]
Since the internal mail hubs will be receiving all external mail exclusively from the gateway, 
it is reasonable to configure the gateway to make greater demands on the capacity of the internal SMTP servers.[br]
The tuning of the inbound concurrency limits need not be trial and error.[br]
 A high volume capable mailhub should be able to easily handle 50 or 100 (rather than the default 20) simultaneous connections, 
 especially if the gateway forwards to multiple MX hosts.[br]
When all MX hosts are up and accepting connections in a timely fashion, throughput will be high.[br]
If any MX host is down and completely unresponsive, the average connection latency rises to at least 1/N * $smtp_connection_timeout, if there are N MX hosts.[br]
This limits throughput to at most the destination concurrency * N / "smtp connection timeout".
[br]For example, with a destination concurrency of 100 and 2 MX hosts, each host will handle up to 50 simultaneous connections.[br]
If one MX host is down and the default SMTP connection timeout is 30s, the throughput limit is [code]100 * 2 / 30 ~= 6[/code] messages per second.[br]
This suggests that high volume destinations with good connectivity and multiple MX hosts need a lower connection timeout, values as low as [code]5s[/code] or even [code]1s[/code]
can be used to prevent congestion when one or more, but not all MX hosts are down.[br]
If necessary, set a higher "transport destination concurrency limit" and a lower "smtp connection timeout" 
(with a "-o" override in master.cf since this parameter has no per-transport name) for the relay transport and any transports dedicated for specific high volume destinations.

[b]Secure SMTP over Transport Layer Security[/b][br]SMTP servers and clients normally communicate in the clear over the Internet.[br]
In many cases, this communication goes through one or more router that is not controlled or trusted by either entity.[br]
Such an untrusted router might allow a third party to monitor or alter the communications between the server and client.[br]
Further, there is often a desire for two SMTP agents to be able to authenticate each others` identities.[br]
For example, a secure SMTP server might only allow communications from other SMTP agents it knows, or it might act differently for messages received from an agent it knows than from one it doesn't know.[br]
TLS [TLS], more commonly known as SSL, is a popular mechanism for  enhancing TCP communications with privacy and authentication.

 and based on that the router decides whether or not to redirect the traffic.[br]
  This means that if your cache becomes unavailable, 
  the router will automatically stop attempting to forward traffic to it and end users will 
  not be affected (and likely not even notice that your cache is out of service).[br]
  For WCCP to work, you firstly need to configure your Squid Cache, and additionally configure the host OS to redirect the HTTP traffic from port 80 to whatever port your Squid box is listening to the traffic on.

 responses to address requests from Mail server according to an appropriate statistical model.[br]
In its simplest implementation Round-robin DNS works by responding to DNS requests not only with a single IP address,[br]
 but a list of IP addresses of several servers that host identical services.[br]
The order in which IP addresses from the list are returned is the basis for the term round robin.[br]
 With each DNS response, the IP address sequence in the list is permuted. Usually, basic IP clients attempt connections with the first 
address returned from a DNS query so that on different connection attempts clients would receive service from different providers, thus distributing the overall load among servers.

How often the Postfix queue manager's scheduler is allowed to preempt delivery of one message with another.[br]
Each transport maintains a so-called "available delivery slot counter" for each message.[br]
One message can be preempted by another one when the other message can be delivered using no more delivery slots (i.e., invocations of delivery agents) than the current message counter has accumulated (or will eventually accumulate - see about slot loans below). This parameter controls how often is the counter incremented - it happens after each default_delivery_slot_cost recipients have been delivered.[br]
The cost of 0 is used to disable the preempting scheduling completely.[br]
The minimum value the scheduling algorithm can use is 2 - use it if you want to maximize the message throughput rate.[br]
Although there is no maximum, it doesn't make much sense to use values above say 50.[br]
The only reason why the value of 2 is not the default is the way this parameter affects the delivery of mailing-list mail.[br]
In the worst case, their delivery can take somewhere between (cost+1/cost) and (cost/cost-1) times more than if the preemptive scheduler was disabled.[br]
The default value of 5 turns out to provide reasonable message response times while making sure the mailing-list deliveries are not extended by more than 20-25 percent even in the worst case.

 typically to improve storage utilization.[br]
 In the deduplication process, duplicate data is deleted, leaving only one copy of the data to be stored, along with references to the unique copy of data.[br]
 Deduplication is able to reduce the required storage capacity since only the unique data is stored.[br]
Data deduplication increases the speed of service and reduces costs.[br]
The benefits from data deduplication start with increasing overall data integrity and end with reducing overall data protection costs.[br]
Data deduplication lets users reduce the amount of disk they need for backup by 90 percent or more, and with reduced acquisition costs—and reduced power, space, and cooling requirements.[br]
Deduplication can also provide significant energy, space, cooling and costs savings, by reducing the amount of data stored. It contributes significantly in the process of Data Center Transformation through reducing carbon footprints due to savings on storage space and reduces the recurring cost of human resource to management and administration.[br]
