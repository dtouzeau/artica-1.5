<MaxKeepAliveRequests>Max KeepAlive Requests</MaxKeepAliveRequests>
<MaxKeepAliveRequests_text>Max KeepAlive Requests</MaxKeepAliveRequests_text>
<MaxRequestsPerChild>Maximal Requests Per Child</MaxRequestsPerChild>
<MaxRequestsPerChild_text>
the maximum number of requests that a child process can serve.[br]
After this number has been reached, process dies.[br]
The goal of this parameter is to minimize the risk of memory leaks and increase the stability of c-icap.[br]
It can be disabled by setting its value to 0

<MinSpareThreads_text>
if the number of the available threads is less than this number, the c-icap server starts a new child

<srv_clamav.SendPercentData>Percentage of data that can be sent</srv_clamav.SendPercentData>
<srv_clamav.SendPercentData_text>
The percentage of data that can be sent by the c-icap server before receiving the complete body of a request.[br]
This feature in conjuction with the folowing can be usefull becouse if the download of the object takes a lot of time the connection of web client to proxy can be expired. It must be noticed that the data which delivered to the web client maybe contains a virus or a part of a virus and can be dangerous.[br]
In the other hand partial data (for example 5% data of a zip or an exe file) in most cases can not be used.[br]
Set it to 0 to disable this feature.

</srv_clamav.StartSendPercentDataAfter>
<srv_clamav.StartSendPercentDataAfter_text>
    Only if the object is bigger than size then the percentage of data which defined by "Percentage of data that can be sent"
    sent by the c-icap server before receiving the complete body of request.
