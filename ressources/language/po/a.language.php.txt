<AddDefaultCharset_explain>This directive specifies a default value for the media type charset parameter (the name of a character encoding) to be added to a response if and only if the response's content-type is either text/plain or text/html.[br]
This should override any charset specified in the body of the response via a META element,
though the exact behavior is often dependent on the user's client configuration.[br]
A setting of "Off" disables this functionality.[br]
AddDefaultCharset "On" enables a default charset of iso-8859-1.[br]
Any other value is assumed to be the charset to be used, which should be one of the IANA registered charset values for use in MIME media types.[br]

"noinc"    - do level 0 dumps every time.[br]
"skip"     - skip all dumps.  Useful for sharing a single node list in several configurations.[br]
"incronly" - do only incremental dumps. This is similar to strategy 'nofull', but will increase the dump level as usual. Full dumps will only be performed when an 'amadmin force' has been issued

<authoritativeDHCP_explain>
The DHCP server will normally assume that the configuration information about a given network segment is not known to be correct 
and is not authoritative.[br]
This is so that if a naive user installs a DHCP server not fully understanding how to configure it,
 it does not send spurious DHCPNAK messages to clients that have obtained addresses from a legitimate DHCP server on the network.[br]
Network administrators setting up authoritative DHCP servers for their networks should always use authoritative to indicate that the DHCP server should 
send DHCPNAK messages to misconfigured clients.[br]
If this is not done, clients will be unable to get a correct IP address after changing subnets until their old lease has expired, 
which could take quite a long time.[br]
However, if a DHCP server is to be set up so that it is aware of some networks for which it is authoritative and 
some networks for which it is not, it may be more appropriate to declare authority on a per-network-segment basis.[br]
Note that the most specific scope for which the concept of authority makes any sense is the physical network segment 
- either a shared-network statement or a subnet statement that is not contained within a shared-network statement[↓r]
It is not meaningful to specify that the server is authoritative for some subnets within a shared network, 
but not authoritative for others, nor is it meaningful to specify that the server is authoritative for some 
host declarations and not others.

Apache can be configured in both a forward and reverse proxy mode.[br]
An ordinary forward proxy is an intermediate server that sits between the client and the origin server.[br]
In order to get content from the origin server, the client sends a request to the proxy naming the origin server as the target 
and the proxy then requests the content from the origin server and returns it to the client.[br]
The client must be specially configured to use the forward proxy to access other sites.[br]
A typical usage of a forward proxy is to provide Internet access to internal clients that are otherwise restricted by a firewall

<High_Fly_Writes_text>HDD producers implement a Fly Height Monitor that attempts to provide additional protections for 
write operations by detecting when a recording head is flying outside its normal operating range.[br]
If an unsafe fly height condition is encountered, the write process is stopped, and the information is rewritten or reallocated to a safe region of the hard drive.[br]
This attribute indicates the count of these errors detected over the lifetime of the drive.[br]
This feature is implemented in most modern Seagate drives and some of Western Digital’s drives,
 beginning with the WD Enterprise WDE18300 and WDE9180 Ultra2 SCSI hard drives,
  and will be included on all future WD Enterprise products.</High_Fly_Writes_text>

This feature allows you to tweak memory, bandwidth and CPU usage of system processes as well as deny access to system resources.[br]
The biggest advantage of Process Groups is to impose limits on different workloads.[br]
So they get their required performance and/or don't impact other workloads running on the same server.[br]
In this section, you can limit how much CPU/memory applications is going to use or build more complex balancing policies.[br]
When you are consolidating many workloads in a single server, it's extremely important to guarantee how much resources they are using.[br]
Something that is inherently done when you have many physical servers because each box is a resource limit on itself.

<iscsi_explain>iSCSI is an abbreviation of Internet Small Computer System Interface, 
an Internet Protocol (IP)-based storage networking standard for linking data storage facilities.[br]
By carrying SCSI commands over IP networks, iSCSI is used to facilitate data transfers over intranets and to manage storage
 over long distances.[br]
 iSCSI can be used to transmit data over local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs),

<iscsi_IoType_explain>In File I/O  mode  (default),  it  defines  a  mapping  between  a "Logical  Unit Number" and a given device , which can be any block device (including regular  block  devices  like hdX and sdX and virtual block devices like LVM and Software RAID  devices) or regular files.[br][br]
In Block I/O it defines a mapping between  a  "Logical  Unit Number" and a given block device.[br]
This mode will perform direct block i/o with the device,  bypassing  page-cache for  all operations.[br]
This allows for efficient handling of non-aligned sector transfers (virtualized  environments)  and  large block  transfers  (media servers).[br]
This mode works ideally with high-end storage HBAs and for applications that  either  do  not need  caching  between  application  and  disk or need the large block throughput.

Kaspersky Anti-Virus for Proxy Server provides anti-virus protection for network traffic routed through proxy servers
which support the Internet Content Adaptation Protocol (ICAP).[br]
[b]The program allows:[/b][br]
Perform anti-virus scans on objects transferred through the proxy server.[br]
Cure infected objects, or block access to infected objects if disinfection fails.[br]
Use group settings to define filtration parameters that are applied depending on the address of the user
requesting an object, and the object's address (URL).[br]
Log activity statistics, including information about anti-virus scanning and its results, and application errors and
warnings.[br]
Notify administrators about detection of malicious software.[br]
[i]The anti-virus databases are used in the detection and disinfection of infected objects. The application uses
database records to analyze every object, checking it for virus presence: its content is compared with code
typical for specific viruses.[/i]

Soft limits allow for greater sharing of memory.[br]
The idea behind soft limits is to allow control groups to use as much of the memory as needed, provided
[br]
a. There is no memory contention[br]
b. They do not exceed their hard limit[br]
[br]
When the system detects memory contention or low memory, control groups
are pushed back to their soft limits.[br]If the soft limit of each control
group is very high, they are pushed back as much as possible to make
sure that one control group does not starve the others of memory.[br]
Please note that soft limits is a best effort feature, it comes with
no guarantees, but it does its best to make sure that when memory is
heavily contended for, memory is allocated based on the soft limit
hints/setup.

Why "specific option"? This is a special vendor-specific scope option that you need to define on your DHCP server.[br]
For example, Avaya phones are hard coded to "read" this scope option and pick up whatever settings you place there.

<POSTFWD2_ABOUT>PostFwd2 uses the postfix policy delegation protocol to control access to the mail 
system before a message has been accepted[br]
It allows you to choose an action (e.g. reject, dunno) for a combination of several smtp parameters.[br]
Major features[br]
[br]Complex combinations of smtp parameters in a single rule;
[br]Macros/ACLs/Groups for frequently used statements;
[br]Combined asynchronous dnsbl lookups with arbitrary actions depending on the results;
(e.g. allows dns whitelists or selective greylisting based on rbl lookup results);
[br]Automatic deactivation of non-responding dnsbls;
[br]Rate limits for message count and size;
[br]Scoring system for fine granular access control;
[br]Date/time based rules;
[br]Conditional jumps to certain rules (like iptables -j);
[br]Internal caching for requests and dns lookups; 
</POSTFWD2_ABOUT>
<postfwd2_action_rate>Creates a counter which will be increased any time a request containing it arrives. if it exceeds max within time seconds, the message was rejected</postfwd2_action_rate>
<postfwd2_action_rcpt>the rate counter is increased by the request's recipient count attribute sended by postfix</postfwd2_action_rcpt>
<postfwd2_action_redirect>After  the  message  is queued, send the message to the  specified  address  instead  of  the  intended recipient(s).
[br]Note:  this action overrides, and currently affects all recipients of the message.</postfwd2_action_redirect>
<postfwd2_action_score>Must be a floating point value eg (0.01 or 1.5).[br]
You can increment using operators:[br]
+n.nn   adds n.nn to current score[br]
-n.nn   sustracts n.nn from the current score[br]
*n.nn   multiplies the current score by n.nn[br]
/n.nn   divides the current score through n.nn[br]
=n.nn   sets the current score to n.nn[br]
When messages arrives, the current score is 0 and by default, the max score is 5.0[br]
So if set +1.5 then add 1.5 to current score.[br]
</postfwd2_action_score>
<postfwd2_action_size>The rate counter is increased by the request's size attribute :[br]1572864 = 1.5MB.[br]if it exceeds max within time seconds, the message was rejected</postfwd2_action_size>

"request from" is the name of a local virtual path; "redirect to" is a partial URL for the remote server.[br]
Examples:[br]
Redirect all connections to 192.168.1.101 on port 8088[br]
request from: /[br]
redirect to: http://192.168.1.101:8088[br]
[br]
Redirect */mirror/foo connections to foo.com[br]
request from: /mirror/foo[br]
redirect to: http://foo.com[br]
[br]
Redirect */video connections to http://cam.hometranet.home:5555/cams/sony/stream [br]
request from: /video[br]

This backend is recommended for new installations that do not require LDAP system.
As a general guide, the Samba Team does not recommend using the tdbsam backend for sites that have 250 or more users.[br]
All Windows accounts have a unique security identifier (SID).[br]
The last four digits of this identifier are unique within any given domain and are called the relative identifier (RID).[br]
The RID module maps IDs by adding the RID to the minimum value in the idmap range (100000 - 199999).[br]

<SAMBA_REMOTE_ANNOUNCE_EXPLAIN>This section can be used to forcibly ensure that all the NetBIOS names on a network get announced to a remote network</SAMBA_REMOTE_ANNOUNCE_EXPLAIN>
<SAMBA_REMOTE_ANNOUNCE_EXPLAIN_FIELD>You can add ip addresses like 192.168.12.23 or 192.168.1.255 where 192.168.12.23 is either the LMB IP address or the broadcast address of the remote network That is, the LMB is at 192.168.12.23, or the address could be given as 192.168.1.255 where the netmask is assumed to be 24 bits
(255.255.255.0).[br]When the remote announcement is made to the broadcast address of the remote network, every host will receive our announcements. This is noisy and therefore undesirable but may be necessary if we do not know the IP address of the remote LMB.
DOMAIN is optional (the workgroup) and can be either our own workgroup or that of the remote network.[br]
If you use the workgroup name of the remote network, our NetBIOS machine names will end up looking like they belong to that workgroup.[br]
This may cause name resolution problems and should be avoided.
</SAMBA_REMOTE_ANNOUNCE_EXPLAIN_FIELD>
<samba_strict_allocate>Windows storage blocks</samba_strict_allocate>
<samba_strict_allocate_text>controls the handling of disk space allocation in the server.[br]
When this is set the server will change from UNIX behaviour of not committing real disk storage blocks when a file 
is extended to the Windows behaviour of actually forcing the disk system to allocate real storage blocks when a file
 is created or extended to be a given size.[br]
In UNIX terminology this means that Samba will stop creating sparse files.[br]
This can be slow on some systems.[br]
When you work with large files like >100MB or so you may even run into problems with clients running into timeouts.[br]
When you have an extent based filesystem it's likely that we can make use of unwritten extents which allows Samba
 to allocate even large amounts of space very fast and you will not see any timeout problems caused by strict allocate.[br]
 With strict allocate in use you will also get much better out of quota messages in case you use quotas.[br]
 Another advantage of activating this setting is that it will help to reduce file fragmentation.[br]
To give you an idea on which filesystems this setting might currently be a good option for you: XFS, ext4, btrfs, ocfs2 on Linux and JFS2 on AIX support unwritten extents.[br]
On Filesystems that do not support it, preallocation is probably an expensive operation where you will 
see reduced performance and risk to let clients run into timeouts when creating large files.[br]
Examples are ext3, ZFS, HFS+ and most others, so be aware if you activate this setting on those filesystems
</samba_strict_allocate_text>
<samba_strict_locking>handling of file locking</samba_strict_locking>
<samba_strict_locking_text>Sets the strict locking option and causes Samba to check for locks on every access,

 Windows applications from corrupting shared files.[br]However, it is slow and should typically be avoided</samba_strict_locking_text>
<samba_sync_always>Always synchronize</samba_sync_always>
<samba_sync_always_text>used to "sync always" and causes Samba to flush every write to disk.[br]
This is good if your server crashes constantly, but the performance costs are immense.[br]
SMB servers normally use oplocks and automatic reconnection to avoid the ill effects of crashes,
 so setting this option is not normally necessary</samba_sync_always_text>
<samba_virtual_explain>Virtual servers are a technique for creating the illusion of multiple NetBIOS servers on the network,
when in reality there is only one.[br]
The technique is simple to implement: a machine simply registers more than one NetBIOS name in association with its IP address.[br]
There are tangible benefits to doing this.[br]
The accounting department, for example, might have an accounting server, and clients of it would see just the accounting disks and printers. The marketing department could have their own server, marketing, with their own reports, and so on. However,
 all the services would be provided by one medium-sized Unix workstation (and one relaxed administrator),
  instead of having one small server and one administrator per department.
</samba_virtual_explain>
<samba_wins_explain>broadcasting - whether it be browsing or name registration and resolution - does not pass easily across 
multiple subnets.[br]
In addition, many broadcasts tend to bog down networks.[br]
To solve this problem, Microsoft now provides the Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS),
 a cross-subnet NBNS, which Samba supports.[br]
 With it, an administrator can designate a single machine to act as a WINS server,
 and can then provide each client that requires name resolution the address of the WINS server.[br]
 Consequently, name registration and resolution requests can be directed to a single machine from any point on the network, 
 instead of broadcast.

<set_cachesize>size of the shared memory buffer pool</set_cachesize>
<set_cachesize_text>
 Sets the size of the shared memory buffer pool — that is, the cache.[br]
 The cache should be the size of the normal working data set of the application, 
 with some small amount of additional memory for unusual situations.[br]
 (Note: the working set is not the same as the number of pages accessed simultaneously, and is usually 
 much larger.)[br]
The value specified for this parameter is the maximum value that your application will be able to use for your in-memory cache. If your application does not have enough data to fill up the amount of space specified here, then your application will only use the amount of memory required by the data that your application does have.
For the DB, the default cache size is 8MB.[br]
You cannot specify a cache size value of less than 100KB.[br]
Any cache size less than 500MB is automatically increased by 25% to account for cache overhead;
 cache sizes larger than 500MB are used as specified.[br]
 The maximum size of a single cache is 4GB on 32-bit systems and 10TB on 64-bit systems.[br]
 (All sizes are in powers-of-two, that is, 256KB is 2^18 not 256,000.)[br]
It is possible to specify cache sizes large enough they cannot be allocated contiguously on some architectures.[br]
 For example, some releases of Solaris limit the amount of memory that may be allocated contiguously by a 
 process.[br]
If ncache is 0 or 1, the cache will be allocated contiguously in memory.[br]
If it is greater than 1, the cache will be split across ncache separate regions, where the region size 
is equal to the initial cache size divided by ncache.[br]
The cache size supplied to this parameter will be rounded to the nearest multiple of the region size and 
may not be larger than the maximum possible cache size configured for your application 
(use the set_cache_max to do this).[br]
The ncache parameter is ignored when resizing the cache.
The syntax of this parameter is a single line with the string one or more whitespace characters, 
and the initial cache size specified in three parts: the gigabytes of cache, the additional bytes of cache,and the number of caches, also separated by whitespace characters.

<set_lg_bsize>size of the in-memory log buffer</set_lg_bsize>
<set_lg_bsize_text>Sets the size of the in-memory log buffer.[br]
For the DB, when the logging subsystem is configured for on-disk logging, the default size of 
the in-memory log buffer is approximately 32KB.[br]
For the BDB SQL interface, when the logging subsystem is configured for on-disk logging,
 the default size of the in-memory log buffer is approximately 64KB.[br]
 Log information is stored in-memory until the storage space fills up or a transaction commit forces the 
 information to be flushed to stable storage.[br]
 In the presence of long-running transactions or transactions producing large amounts of data,
larger buffer sizes can increase throughput.[br]
When the logging subsystem is configured for in-memory logging, the default size of the in-memory log 
buffer is 1MB.[br]
Log information is stored in-memory until the storage space fills up or transaction abort or commit frees up
 the memory for new transactions.[br]
 In the presence of long-running transactions or transactions producing large amounts of data, 
 the buffer size must be sufficient to hold all log information that can accumulate during the longest 
 running transaction.[br]
 When choosing log buffer and file sizes for in-memory logs, applications should ensure the in-memory 
 and avoid a state where the in-memory buffer is full and no space can be freed because a 
 transaction that started in the first log "file" is still active.</set_lg_bsize_text>
<set_lg_max>Maximum size of a single file in the log</set_lg_max>
<set_lg_max_text>
Sets the maximum size of a single file in the log.[br]
The value set for this parameter may not be larger than the maximum unsigned four-byte value.[br]
When the logging subsystem is configured for on-disk logging, the default size of a log file is 10MB.[br]
When the logging subsystem is configured for in-memory logging, the default size of a log file is 256KB.[br]
In addition, the configured log buffer size must be larger than the log file size.[br]
(The logging subsystem divides memory configured for in-memory log records into "files", 
as database environments configured for in-memory log records may exchange log records with 
other members of a replication group, and those members may be configured to store log records on-disk.)[br]
When choosing log buffer and file sizes for in-memory logs, applications should ensure the in-memory log buffer size is large enough that no transaction 
will ever span the entire buffer, and avoid a state where the in-memory buffer
 is full and no space can be freed because a transaction that started in the first log "file" 
 is still active. 
</set_lg_max_text>
<set_lg_regionmax>size of the underlying logging area</set_lg_regionmax>
<set_lg_regionmax_text>
Sets the size of the underlying logging area of the Berkeley DB environment.[br]
By default, or if the value is set to 0, the minimum region size is used, approximately 128KB.[br]
The log region is used to store filenames, and so may need to be increased in size if a large number of files will be opened and registered with the specified Berkeley DB environment's log manager

<squidcacheperf_howto>Your proxy service is intended to store internet objects into the server local disks.[br]
In this case, when users requesting objects, objects should be downloaded directly from the proxy and not from Internet.[br]
This to safe your Internet bandwith and to speed the retreival object trough the local network (10Mb/100Mb/1Gb).[br]
If your cache is under 50% performance ratio, this means your server is misconfigured and you have to change some parameters.[br]
It depends on what kind of objects your users downloading from Internet.[br]
For example streaming videos cannot be cached by your server but their filesize are calculated in statistics.[br]
So if you using a lot of websites that provides streaming, it is normal that you have a lower performance.[br]
You have several ways to increase the caching performance:</squidcacheperf_howto>

[li]It causes path-MTU (PMTUD) to fail, possibly making some remote sites inaccessible.[br] This is not usually a problem if your client machines are connected via Ethernet or DSL PPPoATM where the MTU of all links between the cache and client is 1500 or more. If your clients are connecting via DSL PPPoE then this is likely to be a problem as PPPoE links often have a reduced MTU (1472 is very common).[/li]
[li]On older IE versions before version 6, the ctrl-reload function did not work as expected.[/li]

Enable WhiteListing will turn the proxy to the opposite.[br]
All requests to "unknown" websites or websites not stored in allowed category will be banned.[br]
When websites are banned, you can allow users or some users to add blocked website to the allowed category.
The categorized website can be allowed automatically or wait your confirmation.

<zarafa_indexer_explain>This feature offers full text searching capabilities for the Zarafa Server.[br]
The service will periodically index all mails, and optionally their attachments, from the server.[br]
When searching for a particular mail, the required time to find the requested emails will be seriously reduced.[br]
When attachment indexing is enabled, it is even possible to index the contents of attached files (for common file types).
</zarafa_indexer_explain>
<zarafa_innodb_buffer_pool_size>
the memory buffer that InnoDB uses to cache data and indexes of its tables.[br]
The larger you set this value, the less disk I/O is needed to access data in tables.[br]
On a dedicated Zarafa server, you may set this to up to 50% of the machine physical memory size.[br]
However, do not set it too large because competition for the physical memory might cause paging in the operating system,
 or even out of memory problems. 
</zarafa_innodb_buffer_pool_size>
<zarafa_innodb_log_buffer_size>
size that InnoDB uses to write to the log files on disk.[br]
A large log buffer allows large transactions to run without a need to write the log to disk before the transactions commit.[br]
If you have big transactions, making the log buffer larger will save disk I/O.
This value should be 32Mb.
</zarafa_innodb_log_buffer_size>
<zarafa_innodb_log_file_size>
Size of the transaction log.[br]
By default there are two logfiles.[br]
The preferred value size for the is 25% of the innodb buffer pool size</zarafa_innodb_log_file_size>
<zarafa_mysql_tuning_text>It is imperative that you correctly configure MySQL to achieve maximum performance on your server;[br]
Almost all performance bottlenecks are within the database access itself, so getting your SQL queries to run as quickly as 
possible is very important.[br]
For large installations, it is also a good idea to tune Zarafa's cache parameters as well;[br]
These are normally set quite low to make sure that Zarafa can run on relatively low-end servers,
but in anything but the smallest installations, these defaults needs to be upped.[br]
Any installation with 50 or more users should definitely tune the cache parameters for maximum performance.
</zarafa_mysql_tuning_text>
<zarafa_orphans_explain>
When a user is deleted the mailbox of the user will be still kept in the database.
This store is "orphaned" because nobody can access to it but data kept stored.[br]
In this section you can re-link a store to the current user.[br]
When a store is hooked to a user that already has a store attached to it,
 the original store will be orphaned
</zarafa_orphans_explain>
