r leased line when SMTP isn't desired.[br]Fetchmail can collect mail using any variant of POP or IMAP and forwards to a the local SMTP (via TCP socket)
or LMTP (via TCP or Unix socket) listener or into an MDA program, enabling all the normal forwarding/filtering/aliasing mechanisms
that would apply to local mail or mail arriving via a full-time TCP/IP connection
</APP_FETCHMAIL_DEFS>
<APP_JCHECKMAIL_DEFS>j-chkmail is a mail filtering software using sendmail milter API.[br]
j-chkmail is compatible with UNIX based mailservers running sendmail or postfix.[br]

as fast as possible and as well as possible.[br]
Originally, it's intended to be use in large and heterogeneous communities such as university campus, but not only.[br]
It's a complete and integrated solution including both behavioural filtering
(connection rate control, detection of suspicious behaviour, greylisting , …)
and content filtering (statistical/bayesian content filtering,
pattern matching, URL filtering and heuristic filtering). j-chkmail detects virus by looking for suspicious attached
files (defined by their filename extensions or by some regular expression).[br]
An external message scanner such as Clamd (from ClamAV) can also be called during message handling.
