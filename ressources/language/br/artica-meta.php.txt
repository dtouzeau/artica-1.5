<default_delivery_slot_cost_text>
How often the Postfix queue manager's scheduler is allowed to preempt delivery of one message with another.[br]
Each transport maintains a so-called "available delivery slot counter" for each message.[br]
One message can be preempted by another one when the other message can be delivered using no more delivery slots (i.e., invocations of delivery agents) than the current message counter has accumulated (or will eventually accumulate - see about slot loans below). This parameter controls how often is the counter incremented - it happens after each default_delivery_slot_cost recipients have been delivered.[br]
The cost of 0 is used to disable the preempting scheduling completely.[br]
The minimum value the scheduling algorithm can use is 2 - use it if you want to maximize the message throughput rate.[br]
Although there is no maximum, it doesn't make much sense to use values above say 50.[br]
The only reason why the value of 2 is not the default is the way this parameter affects the delivery of mailing-list mail.[br]
In the worst case, their delivery can take somewhere between (cost+1/cost) and (cost/cost-1) times more than if the preemptive scheduler was disabled.[br]
The default value of 5 turns out to provide reasonable message response times while making sure the mailing-list deliveries are not extended by more than 20-25 percent even in the worst case.

<file_deduplication>File deduplication</file_deduplication>
<file_deduplication_explain>Data deduplication is a specialized data compression technique for eliminating coarse-grained redundant data,
 typically to improve storage utilization.[br]
 In the deduplication process, duplicate data is deleted, leaving only one copy of the data to be stored, along with references to the unique copy of data.[br]
 Deduplication is able to reduce the required storage capacity since only the unique data is stored.[br]
Data deduplication increases the speed of service and reduces costs.[br]
The benefits from data deduplication start with increasing overall data integrity and end with reducing overall data protection costs.[br]
Data deduplication lets users reduce the amount of disk they need for backup by 90 percent or more, and with reduced acquisition costs—and reduced power, space, and cooling requirements.[br]
Deduplication can also provide significant energy, space, cooling and costs savings, by reducing the amount of data stored. It contributes significantly in the process of Data Center Transformation through reducing carbon footprints due to savings on storage space and reduces the recurring cost of human resource to management and administration.[br]

<postscreen_pipelining_explain>By default, SMTP is a half-duplex protocol: the sender and receiver send one command and one response at a time.[br]
Unlike the Postfix SMTP server, postscreen does not announce support for ESMTP command pipelining.[br]
