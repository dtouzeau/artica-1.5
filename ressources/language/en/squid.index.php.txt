<access_rules_text>Allowing or Denying access based on defined access lists[br]
"Access Control list" are linked to a rule statement that tells Squid whether or not to deny or allow traffic that matches the ACL.[br]
Squid matches each Web access request it receives by checking the rule list from top to bottom.[br]
If it finds a match, it enforces the allow or deny statement and stops reading further.[br]
You have to be careful not to place a deny statement in the list that blocks a similar allow statement below it.</access_rules_text>
<acl>Acl</acl>
<acls>Access Control list</acls>
<acls_text>Access control settings are among the most important features of Squid.[br]
You can configure Squid to set filters for various entities and at different granularities (e.g. filters for specific protocols,
filters for certain types of commands, filters for specific routers, filters for specified domains, etc).[br]</acls_text>
<acl_arp>Ethernet Address (unix only)</acl_arp>
<acl_arp_text>This option only works for clients on the same local subnet, and only for certain platforms.[br]
Linux, Solaris, and some BSD variants are the supported operating systems for this type of ACL.[br]
This ACL can provide a somewhat secure method of access control, because MAC addresses are usually harder to spoof than IP addresses,
and you can guarantee that your clients are on the local network (otherwise no ARP resolution can take place).
[br]
[b]EX:[/b][br]acl ACLARP arp 11:12:13:14:15:16[br]
ACLARP refers MACADDRESS of the ethernet 11:12:13:14:15:16[br]
[br][b]Note[/b]
[br][i]Squid can only determine the MAC address for clients that are on the same subnet. If the client is on a different subnet, then Squid
cannot find out its MAC address.[/i]</acl_arp_text>

<acl_browser>Browser matching</acl_browser>
<acl_browser_text>This is A regular expression that matches the clients browser type based on the user agent header[br]
This allows for ACL's to operate based on the browser type in use, for example, using this ACL type, one could create an ACL for
Netscape users and another for Internet Explorer users.[br]
Example:[br]
[b]MOZILLA[/b]
This refers to the requests, which are coming from the browsers who have "MOZILLA" keyword in the user-agent header.</acl_browser_text>

The authenticate_ip_ttl parameter controls the timeout on the ip entries.[br]
[br][b]Note:[br]
1. Any authentication program must be running for this. [br]
NCSA will a simple configuration.
[br]2. In acceleration mode or where there is mesh of child proxies, clients may appear to come from multiple addresses if they are going through proxy farms, so a limit of 1 may cause user problems.[/b]

<http_reply_access>Proxy Reply restrictions</http_reply_access>
<http_reply_access_text>This is complementary to "Proxy restrictions" which allows or denies clients replies[br]
This is used for filtering based on the acl matchings but on the client requests reply.[br]
If none of the access lines cause a match, then the opposite of the last line will apply.[br]
Thus it is good practice to end the rules with an "allow all" or "deny all" entry.</http_reply_access_text>
<icap_access>ICAP Access rules</icap_access>
<icap_access_text>This section builds up an access control list that is processed for each HTTP request.[br]
If all of the acls match, processing stops at this line.[br]
If the action is to allow, then the specified class or service will be used for this request.[br]
If the action is to deny, then processing will stop without using ICAP for this request.[br]
To make a deny rule clearer, you can use the special class [b]"None"[/b] there</icap_access_text>

Objects greater than the size specified in this tag will not be kept in the memory cache.[br]

keep larger objects from hoarding "ideal amount of memory".</maximum_object_size_in_memory_text>
<maximum_object_size_text>Objects larger than this size will NOT be saved on disk.[br]
The value is specified in kilobytes, and the default is 4 MB.[br]
If you wish to get a high BYTES hit ratio, you should probably increase this (one 32 MB object hit counts for 3200 10 KB hits).[br]
If you wish to increase speed more than your want to save bandwidth, you should leave this low.[br]
During the initial downloading of a file, the downloading time seems to be a normal one,[br]
but if you download the same file again, the time it takes for download will be very minimum.[br]
This indicates that, the file comes from the Cache.</maximum_object_size_text>
