<child_timeout_text>This value increase the timeout for the amavisd process.[br]
The default is only 8 minutes.[br]
When amavisd is used with other mail packages in a post queue structure, 
the message is transferred locally only (from the local mail queue to the amavisd loopback) and is therefore very fast.[br]
 When you use the postfix before-queue filter, the message is being transferred directly from the remote smtp through postfix to amavisd .[br]
So for example if the remote smtp is sending a 20 megabyte message, it may take longer than 8 minutes to transmit the message 
(depending on network bandwidth).[br]
Amavisd would timeout before the message had been transferred and the end user would get the following message: [br]
[i]Out: 451 Error: queue file write error.[/i]
[br][b]Note that you may want to increase this limit even further if you see this error message from Postfix.[/b]</child_timeout_text>

<max_requests>Max Requests</max_requests>
<max_requests_text>Max Requests controls the approximate number of tasks each child process is willing to handle.[br]
 After that the child process terminates and the main daemon provides a new child process to take its place.[br]
On the low side, the number should not be too small in order for the startup cost to be averaged out / sufficiently diluted over an entire child lifetime.[br]
 A value above 5 or 10 meets this goal in most amavisd-new configurations.</max_requests_text>
<max_servers>amavisd child processes to spawn number</max_servers>
<max_servers_text>Specifies the number of instances of amavisd child processes to spawn.[br]
 You should increase or decrease this number depending on how much memory your PC has installed.[br]
  Make sure that this number is synchronized to the smtpd maxproc setting in the postfix/master.cf file
 (so that you don't end up with postfix trying to connect to a non-existant queue).
 For 4000 users a value between 5 and 10 would be a good starting point.[br]
 With low memory (e.g. 256 MB) a value of 2 or 3 would probably do.</max_servers_text>

<postfix_afterqueue>Postfix After-Queue Content Filter</postfix_afterqueue>
<postfix_afterqueue_text>[b]Using Postfix After-Queue Content Filter[/b][br]
Normally, Postfix receives mail, stores it in the mail queue and then delivers it.[br]
With the external content filter, [b]mail is filtered AFTER it is queued.[/b][br]
This approach decouples mail receiving processes from mail filtering processes, and gives you maximal control over how many filtering processes you are willing to run in parallel.[br]
This method will give you all filtering features but it use more processes and memory and there is a risk to flood the Postfix queue if the filter is not be able to scan mails in time.[br]</postfix_afterqueue_text>
<postfix_beforequeue>Postfix before-queue Milter</postfix_beforequeue>
<postfix_beforequeue_text>[b]Using Postfix before-queue Milter support[/b][br]
Postfix version 2.3 introduces support for the Sendmail version 8 Milter (mail filter) protocol.[br]
This protocol is used by applications that run outside the MTA to inspect SMTP events (CONNECT, DISCONNECT), SMTP commands (HELO, MAIL FROM, etc.)
as well as mail content (headers and body).[br][b]All this happens before mail is queued.[/b][br]
This method will use amavisd-milter process in order to hook postfix and use less processes and memory to perform email filtering operations[br]
But there are some limitations according messages content modifications.[br]
For example, you will not be able to user Altermime disclaimers for yours outgoing mails</postfix_beforequeue_text>
