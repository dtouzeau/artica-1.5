<routes_explain>Once the VPN is operational in a point-to-point capacity between client and server, 
it may be desirable to expand the scope of the VPN so that clients can reach multiple machines on the server network, rather than only the server machine itself.[br]
[b]If you want to force all client communications trough the VPN add a route like 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 [ip ofyour VPN server]</routes_explain>
<SERVER_MODE_TAP>This directive will use your local IP address assigned to OpenServer VPN address.[br]
The NIC interface will be bridged with the VPN server and your local address[br]It's means if your local address is 192.168.3.1, you must set 192.168.3.1 in this form</SERVER_MODE_TAP>
<SERVER_MODE_TUNE>[br]This directive will set up an OpenVPN server which will allocate  addresses to clients out of the given network/netmask.[br]
The server itself will take the ".1" address of the given network for use as the server-side endpoint of the local interface.</SERVER_MODE_TUNE>

<WELCOME_WIZARD>Welcome to the OpenVPN Wizard</WELCOME_WIZARD>
<WELCOME_WIZARD_TEXT>This wizard will help you to create your first Virtual private network server, after this wizard, you will be able 
to connect clients to the network trought Artica server</WELCOME_WIZARD_TEXT>
<WIZARD_FINISH>Wizard end</WIZARD_FINISH>
<WIZARD_FINISH_TEXT>Your Virtual private Network is now set.You can now generate private key for each computer that should connect to Artica server in order to establish the connection.[br]
Apply your server settings</WIZARD_FINISH_TEXT>
<WIZARD_SERVER>Define here the parameters of the OpenVPN in server mode.[br]This will be allow clients to connect to Artica server in order to establish VPN connection[br]
If this server will be a client to another VPN server, disable the server mode</WIZARD_SERVER>
<WIZARD_STEP1>The first step is to create a PKI (Public Key Infrastructure).The PKI generate :
[ul]
[li]A public key for the server and a private key for each client.[/li]
[li]A master certificate nad keys used helping server/clients certificates identification.[/li]
[/ul]
OpenVPN support bi-directionnal authentication based on certificates.This means that clients must be authenticate the certificate and the server must authenticate the client's certificate before establish a trusted communication</WIZARD_STEP1>
