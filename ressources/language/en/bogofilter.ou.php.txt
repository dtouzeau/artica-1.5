<bogo_intro>Bogofilter is a mail filter that classifies mail as spam or ham (non-spam) by a statistical analysis of the message's header and content (body).[br]
The program is able to learn from the user's classifications and corrections.[br]
The statistical technique is known as the Bayesian technique and its use for spam.[br]
Bogofilter will create a words database for each internal user.[br]
