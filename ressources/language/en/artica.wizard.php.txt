<smtp_sasl_auth_enable_text>Postfix SASL support (RFC 4954, formerly RFC 2554) can be used to authenticate remote SMTP clients to the Postfix SMTP server, and to authenticate the Postfix SMTP client to a remote SMTP server.[br]
When receiving mail, the Postfix SMTP server logs the client-provided username, authentication method, and sender address to the maillog file, and optionally grants mail access via the "permit sasl authenticated" UCE restriction.[br]
When sending mail, the Postfix SMTP client can look up the remote SMTP server hostname or destination domain (the address right-hand part) in a SASL password table, and if a username/password is found, it will use that username and password to authenticate to the remote SMTP server</smtp_sasl_auth_enable_text>
