<about>Samba is an Open Source/Free Software suite that provides seamless file and print services to SMB/CIFS clients.[br]
Samba is freely available, unlike other SMB/CIFS implementations,
and allows for interoperability between Linux/Unix servers and Windows-based clients</about>

<disable netbios_text>Enabling  this parameter will disable netbios support in Samba.
[br]Netbios is the only available form of browsing in all windows versions except for 2000 and XP.[br]
[i]Clients that only support netbios won’t be able to see your samba server when netbios support is disabled.[/i][br]
Default: disable netbios =disabled</disable netbios_text>
<domain logons>domain logons</domain logons>
<domain logons_text>If set to enable, the Samba server will provide the netlogon service for Windows 9X network logons for the workgroup it is in.[br]
This  will also  cause  the Samba server to act as a domain controller for NT4 style domain services.[br]
For more details on setting up this feature see the Domain Control chapter of the Samba HOWTO Collection.</domain logons_text>
<domain master>domain master</domain master>
<domain master_text>Tell samba to enable WAN-wide browse list collation.[br]
Setting this option causes server to claim a special domain specific NetBIOS name that  identifies it as a domain master browser for its given workgroup.[br]
Local master browsers in the same workgroup on broadcast-isolated subnets will give this server their local browse lists, and then ask shared server
for a complete copy of the browse list for the  whole wide area network.
[br]Browser clients will then contact their local master browser, and will receive the domain-wide browse list, instead of just the list for their broadcast-isolated subnet.[br]
Note that Windows NT Primary Domain Controllers expect to be able to claim this workgroup specific special NetBIOS name that identifies
them as domain master browsers for that workgroup by default (i.e. there is no way to prevent a Windows NT PDC from attempting to do this).[br]
This means that if this parameter is set and this server claims the special name for a workgroup before a Windows NT PDC is able to do so then cross subnet browsing
will behave strangely and may fail.[br]
If  domain  logons  =  yes,  then  the default behavior is to enable the domain master parameter.[br]
If domain logons is not enabled (the default setting), then neither will domain master be enabled by default.[br]
When domain logons = Yes the default setting for this parameter is Yes, with the result that Samba will be a PDC.[br]
If domain  master  = No, Samba will function as a BDC.[br]
In general, this parameter should be set to ’No’ only on a BDC. [br]

<kav4samba_about>Kaspersky Anti-Virus for Samba Server is designed to protect file storage areas on Samba Servers,
which emulate Windows file servers under the Linux operating system.[br]
Thus, Windows-based users within a heterogeneous network are provided with safe and transparent access to data stored on Linux file servers.[br]
Kaspersky Anti-Virus is easily integrated with the Samba Server and does not require the Samba Server or parts of the operating system to be re-compiled.</kav4samba_about>

<local master_text>This  option allows your server to try and become a local master browser on a subnet.
[br]If set to disabled then your server will not attempt to become a local master browser on a subnet and will also lose in all browsing elections.
By default this value is set to enabled.[br]
Setting  this value to enabled doesn’t mean that Samba will become the local master browser on a subnet,
just that your server will participate in elections for local master browser.[br]
Setting this value to disabled will cause your server never to become a local master browser.</local master_text>

<os level_text>This  value  controls  what  level Samba advertises itself as for browse elections.[br]
The value of this parameter determines whether your server has a chance of becoming a local master browser for the workgroup in the local broadcast area.[br]
[i]Note :By default, Samba will win a local master browsing election over  all  Microsoft  operating  systems  except  a  Windows  NT 4.0/2000 Domain Controller.[br]
This means that a misconfigured Samba host can effectively isolate a subnet for browsing purposes.[br][/i]
This parameter is largely auto-configured in the Samba-3 release series and it is seldom necessary to  manually  over-ride  the  default setting.

Windows grants or denies access and privileges to resources based on ACLs, which use SIDs to uniquely identify users and their group memberships.[br]
