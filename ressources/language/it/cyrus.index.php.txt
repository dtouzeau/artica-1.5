enterprise environments of various sizes using standards based technologies.[br]
Cyrus technologies scale from independent use in email departments to a system centrally managed in a large enterprise</about>
<allowallsubscribe>Allow All Subscribe</allowallsubscribe>
<allowallsubscribe_text>Allow subscription to nonexistent mailboxes.[br]
This option is typically used on backend servers in a Murder so that users  can  subscribe  to  mailboxes  that  don’t  reside on their "home" server.[br]
This option can also be used as  a  workaround  for  IMAP  clients which  don’t  play well with nonexistent or unselectable mailboxes (eg.  Microsoft Outlook)
</allowallsubscribe_text>
