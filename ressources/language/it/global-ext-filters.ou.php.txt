<search_zip>Search for filenames within ZIP</search_zip>
<search_zip_text>Search for filenames within ZIP archives using the internal ZIP parsing[br]Any filenames found are subject to the same checks, for instance Forbidden attachments or good list, with the
notable difference that the rename action has no effect on ZIP files.[br]
This is due to a shortcoming in this version of the filter; by the time the ZIP file is decoded, it is “too late” to rename the attachment. 
[br]Only the delete or kill actions will modify ZIP files.[br]
In order for search zip to have an effect, you must either:
use Forbidden attachments mode  and specify in the Forbidden attachments the kill or delete  actions for select extensions.

<warning_html>Body Html message notification</warning_html>
<warning_html_text>Inserts a warning message into HTML portions of the email when
filtering occurs. The HTML is inserted at a position determined by
htmlwarn_pos (see above) which provides a good hope for adding a
visible warning. Unfortunately, inserting arbitrary HTML is tricky due
to the complexity of markup interactions. Inserting warnings in HTML
may thoroughly disrupt the original message, so use with caution</warning_html_text>
<warning_text>Body Text message notification</warning_text>
<warning_text_text>
If an attachment is filtered, this lets you specify some warning text that
will be inserted into any plain text portion(s) of the email.[br] This is
effective for informing users of filtered files, but the act of inserting
arbitrary text into an email can cause new problems.[br] Use with caution.
