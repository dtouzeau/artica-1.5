<about_cyrus>Cyrus is a highly scalable enterprise mail system designed for use in
enterprise environments of various sizes using standards based technologies.[br]
Cyrus technologies scale from independent use in email departments to a system centrally managed in a large enterprise</about_cyrus>

<about_procmail>Procmail is a powerful and robust set of tools that enable you to automatically process mail as you receive it or after it is already in a message folder.[br]
Procmail is a mail processing utility, which can help you filter your mail, sort incoming mail according to sender, Subject line, length of message, keywords in the message, implement an ftp-by-mail server, and much more.[br]
Procmail is also a complete drop-in replacement for your MDA. (If this doesn't mean anything to you, you don't want to know.) </about_procmail>
<about_roundcube>Roundcube webmail...[br]
...is a browser-based multilingual IMAP client with an application-like user interface.[br]
 It provides full functionality you expect from an e-mail client, including MIME support, address book, folder manipulation, message searching and spell checking.

<acl_check_permissions>check permissions on "open for delete"</acl_check_permissions>
<acl_check_permissions_text>controls what Samba does on receiving a protocol request of "open for delete" from a Windows client.[br]
If a Windows client doesn't have permissions to delete a file then they expect this to be denied at open time.[br]
POSIX systems normally only detect restrictions on delete by actually attempting to delete the file or directory.[br]
As Windows clients can (and do) "back out" a delete request by unsetting the "delete on close" bit Samba cannot delete the file immediately on "open for delete" request as we cannot restore such a deleted file.[br]
With this parameter set (the default) then Samba checks the file system permissions directly on "open for delete" and denies the request without
actually deleting the file if the file system permissions would seem to deny it.[br]
This is not perfect, as it's possible a user could have deleted a file without Samba being able to check the permissions correctly,
but it is close enough to Windows semantics for mostly correct behaviour.[br]
Samba will correctly check POSIX ACL semantics in this case.[br]
If this parameter is set to "false" Samba doesn't check permissions on "open for delete" and allows the open.[br]
If the user doesn't have permission to delete the file this will only be discovered at close time, which is 
too late for the Windows user tools to display an error message to the user.[br]
The symptom of this is files that appear to have been deleted "magically" re-appearing on a Windows explorer refresh</acl_check_permissions_text>

<acl_enabled>ACLs enabled</acl_enabled>
<acl_feature_about>Access Control Lists (ACLs) provide a much more flexible way of specifying permissions on a file or other object than the standard Unix user/group/owner system.[br]Windows NT and above, when running on an NTFS partition, use ACLs to specify permissions on files and directories.[br]This feature allows you to enable/disable ACL support on your system.</acl_feature_about>

<acl_group_control_text>Only the owner of a file or directory and the superuser can modify the permissions and ACLs on a file.[br]
If this parameter is set, then Samba overrides this restriction, and also allows the primary group owner of a file or directory 
to modify the permissions and ACLs on that file.[br] 
This parameter allows Samba to permit delegation of the control over a point in the exported directory hierarchy in much the same way as Windows.</acl_group_control_text>

<address_verify_map_text>
By default, address verification information is not stored in a persistent file.[br]
You have to specify one.[br]Persistent storage is off by default because it may need more disk space than is available in your file system.[br]
Address verification information is cached by the Postfix [i]verify[/i] daemon.
Postfix has a bunch of parameters that control the caching of positive and negative results.[br]
The Address verification database configuration parameter specifies an optional database for sender or recipient address verification results.[br]
If you don't specify a file, all address verification information is lost after "postfix reload" or "postfix stop".
[br]If your /var file system has sufficient space specify here the path to the database eg [code](/var/postfix/verify)[/code]
[br][i]NOTE: Do not put this file in a file system that may run out of space.[/i]
[br] When the address verification table gets corrupted the world comes to an end. Meanwhile, you will not receive mail via SMTP.
The verify daemon process will create a new database when none exists, and will open/create the file before it enters the chroot jail and before it drops root privileges.

 You can change it by using a network socket.[br]Using a network socket allow others remote SMTP servers to directly send messages to this server.[br]
 It is more easy to use because Artica did not need to check file system securities settings.[br]Using a unix local socket will not load the Network card and avoid network security issues.

<DNSBL_EXPLAIN>A DNSBL (DNS-based Blackhole List, Block List, or Blacklist; see below) is a list of IP addresses published through the 
Internet Domain Name Service in a particular format.[br]
DNSBLs are most often used to publish the addresses of computers or networks linked to spamming;
 most mail server software can be configured to reject or flag messages which have been sent from a site listed on one or more such lists.[br]
"DNSBL" is a software mechanism, rather than a specific list or policy.[br]
There are dozens of DNSBLs in existence,[1][2] which use a wide array of standards for listing and delisting of addresses.[br]
These may include listing the addresses of zombie computers or other machines being used to send spam, listing the addresses of ISPs who willingly host spammers, or listing addresses which have sent spam to a honeypot system.[br]
Since the creation of the first DNSBL in 1997, the operation and policies of these lists have been frequently controversial, both in Internet advocacy and occasionally in lawsuits. Many mail system operators and users consider DNSBLs a valuable tool to share information about spam sources, but others including prominent Internet activists have objected to them as a form of censorship. In addition, a small number of DNSBL operators have been the target of lawsuits filed by spammers seeking to have the lists shut down.

On some operating systems, the host file content is used preferentially over other methods, such as the Domain Name System (DNS), but many systems implement name service switches to provide customization.[br]

<fetch>fetch server</fetch>
<fetchmail>fetchmail</fetchmail>
<fetchmail_about>Fetchmail is a one-stop solution to the remote mail retrieval problem for Unix machines, quite useful to anyone with an intermittent PPP or SLIP connection to a remote mailserver.[br]
It can collect mail using any variant of POP or IMAP and forwards via port 25 to the local SMTP listener, enabling all the normal forwarding/filtering/aliasing mechanisms that would apply to local mail or mail arriving via a full-time TCP/IP connection.[br]
Fetchmail is not a toy or a coder's learning exercise, but an industrial-strength tool capable of transparently handling every retrieval demand from those of a simple single-user ISP connection up to mail retrieval and rerouting for an entire client domain.[br]
Fetchmail is easy to configure, unobtrusive in operation, powerful, feature-rich, and well documented.[br]
Fetchmail is open-source software.[br] The openness of the sources is the strongest assurance of quality you can have.[br]
Extensive peer review by a large, multi-platform user community has shown that fetchmail is as near bulletproof as the underlying protocols permit.[br]

<ftp_epsv_all_explain>FTP Protocol extensions permit the use of a special "EPSV ALL" command.[br]
NATs may be able to put the connection on a "fast path" through the translator, as the EPRT command will never be used and therefore,translation of the data portion of the segments will never be needed.[br]
When a client only expects to do two-way FTP transfers this may be useful.[br]
If Squid finds that it must do a three-way FTP transfer after issuing an EPSV ALL command, the FTP session will fail.[br]
If you have any doubts about this option do not use it.[br]Squid will nicely attempt all other connection methods.

<ftp_telnet_protocol_explain>The FTP protocol is officially defined to use the telnet protocol 	as transport channel for the control connection.[br]
However, many implementations are broken and does not respect this aspect of the FTP protocol.[br]
If you have trouble accessing files with ASCII code 255 in the path or similar problems involving this ASCII code you can try setting this directive to off.[br]
If that helps, report to the operator of the FTP server in question that their FTP server is broken and does not follow the FTP standard.

<inet_interfaces_text>
The network interface addresses that this mail system receives mail on.[br]
Specify "all" to receive mail on all network interfaces (default), and "loopback-only" to receive mail on loopback network interfaces only 
(Postfix version 2.2 and later). [br]
The parameter also controls delivery of mail to user@[ip.address].[br]

    [i]Note 1: you need to stop and start Postfix when this parameter changes.[/i][br]

    [i]Note 2: address information may be enclosed inside [], but this form is not required here.[/i]

    [br]
    When inet_interfaces specifies just one IPv4 and/or IPv6 address that is not a loopback address,
     the Postfix SMTP client will use this address as the IP source address for outbound mail.[br]
     Support for IPv6 is available in Postfix version 2.2 and later.[br]

    On a multi-homed firewall with separate Postfix instances listening on the "inside" and "outside" interfaces,
    this can prevent each instance from being able to reach servers on the "other side" of the firewall.
    [br]A better solution for multi-homed firewalls is to leave inet_interfaces at the default value and instead use explicit IP addresses in the master.cf[br]
    SMTP server definitions.
    [br]This preserves the Postfix SMTP client's loop detection, by ensuring that each side of the firewall knows that 
    the other IP address is still the same host.[br]
     Setting $inet_interfaces to a single IPv4 and/or IPV6 address is primarily useful with virtual hosting of domains on secondary IP addresses,
     when each IP address serves a different domain (and has a different $myhostname setting).[br]
	[br]

              it or releases it for delivery.  Log  the  optional

</INFOS_HOLD_EXPLAIN>
<INFOS_PREPEND_EXPLAIN>
[b]PREPEND[/b][br][i]
Prepend  the matched  line  with  the  specified  text, and
              inspect the next rule.[br]

              Notes:

              [li]The prepended text is output on  a  separate
                     line,  immediately  before  the  input  that
                     triggered the PREPEND action.[/li][br]

              [li]The prepended text is not considered part of
                     the  input  stream:  it  is  not  subject to
                     header/body checks or address rewriting, and
                     it does not affect the way that Postfix adds
                     missing message headers.[/li][br]

            [li]When prepending text before a message header
                     line,  the  prepended text must begin with a
                     valid message header label.[br][/li]

              
</INFOS_PREPEND_EXPLAIN>
<INFOS_REDIRECT_EXPLAIN>
[b]REDIRECT[/b][br][i]
Write a message redirection request  to  the  queue
              file,  and  inspect  the next input rule. After the
              message is queued, it will be sent to the specified
              address instead of the intended recipient(s).[br]
Fetchmail is a one-stop solution to the remote mail retrieval problem for Unix machines, quite useful to anyone with an intermittent PPP or SLIP connection to a remote mailserver. It can collect mail using any variant of POP or IMAP and forwards via port 25 to the local SMTP listener, enabling all the normal forwarding/filtering/aliasing mechanisms that would apply to local mail or mail arriving via a full-time TCP/IP connection.

Fetchmail is not a toy or a coder's learning exercise, but an industrial-strength tool capable of transparently handling every retrieval demand from those of a simple single-user ISP connection up to mail retrieval and rerouting for an entire client domain. Fetchmail is easy to configure, unobtrusive in operation, powerful, feature-rich, and well documented.

Fetchmail is open-source software. The openness of the sources is the strongest assurance of quality you can have. Extensive peer review by a large, multi-platform user community has shown that fetchmail is as near bulletproof as the underlying protocols permit.

              Note:  this action overrides the FILTER action, andrewriting of the addresses
              affects all recipients of the message. If  multiple
              REDIRECT  actions  fire,  only the last one is executed.
</INFOS_REDIRECT_EXPLAIN>
<INFOS_REJECT_EXPLAIN>
[b]REJECT[/b][br][i]
Reject  the  entire  message.  Reply  with optional
              text... when the optional text is specified, other-
              wise reply with a generic error message.[br]

              Note:   this  action  disables  further  header  or
              body_checks inspection of the current  message  and
              affects all recipients.[br]

              [br]When no code is specified at the beginning of optional text..., Postfix inserts a default
              enhanced status code of "5.7.1".
</INFOS_REJECT_EXPLAIN>
<INFOS_REPLACE_EXPLAIN>
[b]REPLACE[/b][br][i]
Replace  the  current line with the specified text,and inspect the next input line.[br]
Notes:
[li]When replacing a message  header  line,  the
                     replacement  text  must  begin  with a valid
                     header label.[/li][br]

[li]The replaced text remains part of the  input
                     stream.  Unlike  the result from the PREPEND
                     action, a replaced  message  header  may  be
                     subject  to address rewriting and may affect
                     the way that Postfix  adds  missing  message
                     headers.[/li]
</INFOS_REPLACE_EXPLAIN>
<INFOS_WARN_EXPLAIN>
[b]WARN[/b][br][i]
Log a warning with the optional text... (or  log  a

[b](default: $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain, localhost)[/b]

    This is the list of domains that are delivered via the mail delivery transport.[br]
     By default this is the Postfix local delivery agent which looks up all recipients.[br]
    The default mydestination value specifies names for the local machine only.
    [br] On a mail domain gateway, you should also include $mydomain.
</mydestination_text>
<mydestination_title>What domains to receive mail for ?</mydestination_title>
<myhostname_text>
This parameter specifies the fully-qualified domain name of the machine running the Postfix system.[br] $myhostname appears as the default value in many other Postfix configuration parameters.[br]

By default, myhostname is set to the local machine name.[br] If your local machine name is not in fully-qualified domain name form, or if you run Postfix on a virtual interface, you will have to specify the fully-qualified domain name that the mail system should use.
[br]
Alternatively, if you specify mydomain in main.cf, then Postfix will use its value to generate a fully-qualified default value for the myhostname parameter.[br]
Examples (specify only one of the following):
[ul]
[li]host.local.domain (machine name is not FQDN)[/li]		
[li]host.virtual.domain (virtual interface)[/li]
[li]virtual.domain (virtual interface)[/li]
[/ul]
</myhostname_text>
<myhostname_title>hostname ?</myhostname_title>
<mynetworks_single_text>Specify here subnet and ip address in order to allow sender to relay mail</mynetworks_single_text>
<mynetworks_text>By default, Postfix will forward mail from clients in authorized network blocks to any destination.[br]
Authorized networks are defined groupwith this configuration parameter.[br]
The default is to authorize all clients in the IP subnetworks that the local machine is attached to.[br]
[i]IMPORTANT: If your machine is connected to a wide area network then your default mynetworks setting may be too friendly.[/i]

Examples:[ul]
       [li]127.0.0.0/8   (safe: authorize local machine only)[/li]
       [li]168.100.189.2/32 (authorize local machine)[/li] 
       [li]!192.168.0.1 (not this IP)[/li]
       [li][::1]/128[/li]
       [li][2001:240:587::]/64[/li]
[/ul]
[b]Note: IP version 6 address information must be specified inside [] these addresses contain the ":" character, 
and would otherwise be confused with a "type:table" pattern.
</mynetworks_text>
<mynetworks_title>What clients to relay mail from ?</mynetworks_title>
<myorigin_text>This parameter specifies the domain that appears in mail that is posted on this machine.[br]
The default is to use the local machine name, $myhostname, which defaults to the name of the machine.[br] Unless you are running a really small site, you probably want to change that into $mydomain, which defaults to the parent domain of the machine name.
[br]For the sake of consistency between sender and recipient addresses, myorigin also specifies the domain name that is appended to an unqualified recipient address.</myorigin_text>

<parent_options_proxy_default>If this is a parent cache which can be used as a "last-resort." and not ICP enabled then "default" would 
be the appropriate option.[br]
Simply adding default to a parent does not force all requests to be sent to that parent.[br]
The term default is perhaps a poor choice of words.[br]
If the cache is able to make direct connections, direct will be preferred over default.[br]
If needed to force all requests to parent cache(s), use the never_direct option</parent_options_proxy_default>

Set for those peers, which do not support ICP queries.[br]
It is obvious to have doubt about the ICP port specified in, while using this option.[br]
Squid does not care what digit has been given in the ICP port when no-query is specified.[br]
Using any number is fine.[br]
It is recommended to use 0 to emphasis the fact that ICP is not used in any way (not even to UDP echo port 7).

              address.[br]
              The pattern domain.tld also matches domains
              Otherwise,  specify [code].domain.tld[/code]  (note  the  initial  dot)  in order to match subdomains.

Matches  the specified IPv4 host address or subnetwork.[br]
An IPv4 host address is a  sequence  of  four decimal octets separated by ".".[br]
Subnetworks  are  matched  by repeatedly truncating the last ".octet" from the remote IPv4 host address string  until a match is found in the access table,
or until further truncation is not possible.(eg:192.168.1.0/24)

[br]The real reason for the existence of Postfix restriction classes is more mundane:[br]
you can't specify a lookup table on the right-hand side of a Postfix access table.[br]
This is because Postfix needs to open lookup tables ahead of time, but the reader probably does not care about these low-level details.

<refresh_pattern_intro>This section controls the disk cache only indirectly.[br]
 It helps Squid decide whether or not a given request can be a cache hit or must be treated as a miss.[br]
 Liberal settings increase your cache hit ratio but also increase the chance that users receive a stale response.[br]
 Conservative settings, on the other hand, decrease hit ratios and stale responses.

<refresh_pattern_option>[ul]
[li][b]override-expire[/b][br]
 When set, this option causes Squid to check the min value before checking the Expires header.[br]
Thus, a non-zero min time makes Squid return an unvalidated cache hit even if the response is preexpired.[br][/li]
[li][b]override-lastmod[/b][br]
When set, this option causes Squid to check the min value before the LM-factor percentage.[br][/li]
[li][b]reload-into-ims[/b][br]
When set, this option makes Squid transform a request with a no-cache directive into a validation (If-Modified-Since) request. In other words, Squid adds an If-Modified-Since header to the request before forwarding it on. Note that this only works for objects that have a Last-Modified timestamp. The outbound request retains the no-cache directive, so that it reaches the origin server.[br][/li]
[li][b]ignore-reload[/b][br]
When set, this option causes Squid to ignore the no-cache directive, if any, in the request.[br][/li][/ul]

For example, your system may be turned off outside office hours, it may be behind a firewall, [br]

Specify @domain as a wild-card for domains that have no valid recipient list,

Technically, tables listed with "Relay recipients allowed" are used as lists: Postfix needs to know only if a lookup string is found or not, but it does not use the result from table lookup.[br]
If this parameter is non-empty, then the Postfix SMTP server will reject mail to unknown relay users.[br]

<SambaDnsProxy_explain>A Samba WINS server can check with the system's DNS server if a requested host cannot be found in its WINS database.[br]
This option tell Samba to use the DNS server.[br]
Although this allows Windows clients to resolve fully qualified Internet domain names through the Samba WINS server,
 it will work only for domain names that fit within the 15-character limitation of NetBIOS names.[br]
 For this reason, we recommend you use this feature only to act as a supplement to your WINS server, rather than as a replacement for a DNS server.[br]
 Also, setting this option to checked will degrade your Samba performance.

<sasl_intro>SASL support can be used to authenticate remote SMTP clients to the Postfix SMTP server,
and to authenticate the Postfix SMTP client to a remote SMTP server.[br]
When receiving mail, the Postfix SMTP server logs the client-provided username, 
authentication method, and sender address to the log file, and optionally grants mail access via the "Allow sasl authenticated" in client restriction.[br]
When sending mail, the Postfix SMTP client can look up the remote SMTP server hostname or destination domain (the address right-hand part) 
in a SASL password LDAP, and if a username/password is found, it will use that username and password to authenticate to the remote SMTP server.

<smtp_connection_cache_destinations_text>
With SMTP connection caching, Postfix can deliver multiple messages over the same SMTP connection[br]
SMTP Connection caching is a performance feature.[br]
Whether or not it actually improves performance depends on the conditions
[ul]
[li]SMTP Connection caching can greatly improve performance when delivering mail to a destination with multiple mail servers, because it can help Postfix to skip over a non-responding server.[/li]
[li]Otherwise, the benefits of SMTP connection caching are minor: it eliminates the latency of the TCP handshake (SYN, SYN+ACK, ACK), plus the latency of the SMTP initial handshake (220 greeting, EHLO command, EHLO response).[/li]
[li]SMTP Connection caching gives no gains with respect to SMTP session tear-down. The Postfix sender process normally does not wait for the server's reply to the QUIT command, and it never waits for the TCP final handshake to complete.[/li]
[li]SMTP Connection caching introduces some overhead: the client needs to send an RSET command to find out if a connection is still usable, before it can send the next MAIL FROM command[/li]
[/ul]
 When SMTP connection caching is enabled, the sending process does not disconnect after a mail transaction, but gives the connection to the scache 
 server which keeps the connection open for a limited amount of time.[br]
After handing over the open connection to the scache server, the sender process continues with some other mail delivery request.[br]
Meanwhile, any sender process can ask the scache server for that cached connection and reuse it for mail delivery.[br]
The connection cache can be searched by destination domain name and by the IP address of the host at the other end of the connection.[br]
This allows Postfix to reuse a connection even when the remote host is mail server for domains with different names. 
[h4] The Postfix sender process supports two connection caching strategies[/h4]
[ul]
[li][strong]On-demand connection caching.[/strong]
 This is enabled by default.[br]
 When this feature is enabled, the Postfix sender process automatically saves a connection to the connection cache when a destination has a high volume of mail in the active queue. 
[br][/li]
[li][strong]Per-destination connection caching.[/strong][br]
This is enabled by explicitly listing specific destinations.[br]
After completing delivery to a selected destination, the Postfix sender process [i]always[/i] saves the connection to the connection cache
[/li]
[/ul]
</smtp_connection_cache_destinations_text>
<smtp_connection_cache_on_demand>On-demand connection caching</smtp_connection_cache_on_demand>
<smtp_connection_cache_time_limit>Connection cache time limit</smtp_connection_cache_time_limit>
<smtp_connection_cache_time_limit_text>When SMTP connection caching is enabled, the amount of time that an unused SMTP client socket is kept open before it is closed.[br][i]Do not specify larger values without permission from the remote sites[/i].</smtp_connection_cache_time_limit_text>
<smtp_connection_reuse_time_limit>Connection reuse time limit</smtp_connection_reuse_time_limit>
<smtp_connection_reuse_time_limit_text>The amount of time during which Postfix will use an SMTP connection repeatedly.[br]
The timer starts when the connection is initiated (i.e. it includes the connect, greeting and helo latency, in addition to the latencies of subsequent mail delivery transactions).[br]
This feature addresses a performance stability problem with remote SMTP servers.
[br]This problem is not specific to Postfix: [i]it can happen when any MTA sends large amounts of SMTP email to a site that has multiple MX hosts.[/i][br]
The problem starts when one of a set of MX hosts becomes slower than the rest.[br]
Even though SMTP clients connect to fast and slow MX hosts with equal probability, the slow MX host ends up with more simultaneous inbound connections than the faster MX hosts, 
because the slow MX host needs more time to serve each client request.[br]
[strong]The slow MX host becomes a connection attractor.[/strong]If one MX host becomes N times slower than the rest, it dominates mail delivery 
latency unless there are more than N fast MX hosts to counter the effect.[br]
And if the number of MX hosts is smaller than N, the mail delivery latency becomes effectively that of the slowest MX host divided by the total number of MX hosts.[br]
The solution uses connection caching by limiting the amount of time during which a connection can be used repeatedly (instead of limiting the number of deliveries over that connection),
 Postfix not only restores fairness in the distribution of simultaneous connections across a set of MX hosts, it also favors deliveries over connections 
 that perform well, which is exactly what we want.[br]
The default reuse time limit, [code]300s[/code], is comparable to the various smtp transaction timeouts which are fair estimates of maximum excess 
latency for a slow delivery.[br][i]Note that hosts may accept thousands of messages over a single connection within the default connection reuse time limit.[/i][br]
This number is much larger than the limit of 10 messages per cached connection.[br]
it may prove necessary to lower the limit to avoid interoperability issues with MTAs that exhibit bugs when many messages are delivered via a single connection.
[br]A lower reuse time limit risks losing the benefit of connection reuse when the average connection and mail delivery latency exceeds the reuse time limit.

<smtp_fallback_relay>Fall back relay servers</smtp_fallback_relay>
<smtp_fallback_relay_text>When mail is being deferred frequently,
 fixing the problem is always better than increasing the frequency of delivery attempts.[br]
 However, if you can control only the delivery attempt frequency, consider using a dedicated [strong]fallback relay "graveyard"[/strong] machine for bad destinations,
  so that these destinations do not ruin the performance of normal mail deliveries.[br]
This "graveyard" machine could use shorter retry times parameters for difficult to reach destinations. [br]
If you specify multiple SMTP destinations, Postfix will try them in the specified order.[br]
To prevent mailer loops between MX hosts and fall-back hosts, Postfix version 2.3 and later will not use this feature for destinations that it is MX host for.

A unicast packet is the complete opposite: one machine is talking to only one other machine. All TCP connections are unicast, since they can only have one destination host for each source host.[br]
UDP packets are almost always unicast too, though they can be sent to the broadcast address so that they reach every single machine in some cases.[br][/li]

<title_postfix_tuning>Postfix Performance Tuning</title_postfix_tuning>
<title_postfix_tuning_1>Doing more work with your SMTP server processes</title_postfix_tuning_1>
<title_postfix_tuning_1_text>With Postfix versions 2.0 and earlier, the smtpd server pauses before reporting an error to an SMTP client.
[br]The idea is called tar pitting.[br]However, these delays also slow down Postfix. When the smtpd server replies slowly, sessions take more time, 
so that more smtpd server processes are needed to handle the load.[br]
When your Postfix smtpd( server process limit is reached, new clients must wait until a server process becomes available.[br]
This means that all clients experience poor performance.[br]
You can speed up the handling of smtpd server error replies by turning off the delay by set [code]0[/code]
</title_postfix_tuning_1_text>
<title_postfix_tuning_2> Slowing down SMTP clients that make many errors</title_postfix_tuning_2>
<title_postfix_tuning_2_text>
 The Postfix smtpd server maintains a per-session error count.[br]
 The error count is reset when a message is transferred successfully, and is incremented when a client request is unrecognized or unimplemented,
 when a client request violates access restrictions, or when some other error happens.[br]
As the per-session error count increases, the smtpd server changes behavior and begins to insert delays into the responses.
[br]The idea is to slow down a run-away client in order to limit resource usage.[br]
[i]IMPORTANT: These delays slow down Postfix, too.[br]
When too much delay is configured, the number of simultaneous SMTP sessions will increase until it reaches the smtpd server process limit, 
and new SMTP clients must wait until an smtpd server process becomes available. [/i]
[ul]
[li]When the error count reaches "soft error limit" (default: 10), the Postfix smtpd server delays all non-error and error responses by "error sleep time" seconds (default: 1 second).[/li]
[li]When the error count reaches "hard error limit" (default: 20) the Postfix smtpd server breaks the connection.[/li][/ul]
</title_postfix_tuning_2_text>
<title_postfix_tuning_3>Measures against clients that make too many connections</title_postfix_tuning_3>
<title_postfix_tuning_3_text>
 The Postfix smtpd server can limit the number of simultaneous connections from the same SMTP client,
 as well as the connection rate and the rate of certain SMTP commands from the same client.[br]
 These statistics are maintained by the anvil server (translation: if anvil breaks, then connection limits stop working).[br]
[i]IMPORTANT: These limits must not be used to regulate legitimate traffic: mail will suffer grotesque delays if you do so.[/i]
[br] The limits are designed to protect the smtpd server against abuse by out-of-control clients. </title_postfix_tuning_3_text>
<title_postfix_tuning_4>General mail delivery performance tips</title_postfix_tuning_4>
<title_postfix_tuning_4_text>
[ul]
[li]Don't overwhelm the disk with mail submissions.[br] Optimize the mail submission rate by tuning the number of parallel submissions and/or by tuning the Postfix 
[strong]in flow delay[/strong] parameter setting[/li]

[li]Reduce the [strong]connect timeout[/strong] and [strong]helo timeout[/strong] values so that Postfix does not waste lots of time connecting to non-responding remote SMTP servers.[/li]
[li]Use a [strong][a href=postfix.fallback.relay.php]fallback relay host[/strong][/a] for mail that cannot be delivered upon the first attempt.[br]
 This "graveyard" machine can use shorter retry times for difficult to reach destinations[/li]
[li]Speed up disk updates with a large (64MB) persistent write cache.[br]
This allows disk updates to be sorted for optimal access speed without compromising file system integrity when the system crashes.[/li]
[li]Use a solid-state disk (a persistent RAM disk).[br] This is an expensive solution that should be used in combination with short SMTP timeouts 
and a [a href=postfix.fallback.relay.php]fallback relay "graveyard" machine[/a] that delivers mail for problem destinations.[/li]
 [/ul]
</title_postfix_tuning_4_text>
<title_postfix_tuning_5>Tuning the number of recipients per delivery</title_postfix_tuning_5>
<title_postfix_tuning_5_text>
The [strong]"default destination recipient limit"[/strong] parameter (default: 50) 
controls how many recipients a Postfix delivery agent will send with each copy of an email message.[br]
You can override this setting for specific Postfix delivery agents.[br]
For example, [strong]"uucp destination recipient limit[/strong] = 100" would limit the number of recipients per UUCP delivery to 100.[br]
If an email message exceeds the recipient limit for some destination, the Postfix queue manager 
breaks up the list of recipients into smaller lists.[br]
Postfix will attempt to send multiple copies of the message in parallel.[br]
[i]IMPORTANT: Be careful when increasing the recipient limit per message delivery;[br]
some smtpd servers abort the connection when they run out of memory or when a hard recipient limit is reached, so that the message will never be delivered.[/i][br]
The [strong]"smtpd recipient limit"[/strong] parameter (default: 1000) controls how many recipients the Postfix smtpd server will take per delivery.[br]
The default limit is more than any reasonable SMTP client would send.[br]
The limit exists to protect the local mail system against a run-away client. 
</title_postfix_tuning_5_text>
<title_postfix_tuning_6>Tuning the frequency of deferred mail delivery attempts</title_postfix_tuning_6>
<title_postfix_tuning_6_text>
 When a Postfix delivery agent (smtp(8), local(8), etc.) is unable to deliver a message it may blame the message itself, or it may blame the receiving party.[br]
 [ul]
[li]When the delivery agent blames the message, the queue manager gives the queue file a time stamp into the future, 
so it won't be looked at for a while.[br]
By default, the amount of time to cool down is the amount of time that has passed since the message arrived.[br]
This results in so-called exponential backoff behavior.[/li]
[li]When the delivery agent blames the receiving party (for example a local recipient user, or a remote host), 
the queue manager not only advances the queue file time stamp, but also puts the receiving party on a "dead" list so that it will be skipped for some amount of time.[/li]
[/ul]
This process is governed by a bunch of little parameters.
[ul]
[li][strong]queue run delay[/strong](default: 300 seconds; before Postfix 2.4: 1000s)[br]How often the queue manager scans the queue for deferred mail. [/li]
[li][strong]minimal backoff time[/strong] (default: 300 seconds; before Postfix 2.4: 1000s)[br]
The minimal amount of time a message won't be looked at, and the minimal amount of time to stay away from a "dead" destination.[/li]
[li][strong]maximal backoff time[/strong] (default: 4000 seconds)[br]The maximal amount of time a message won't be looked at after a delivery failure. [/li]
[li][strong]maximal queue lifetime[/strong] (default: 5 days)[br]How long a message stays in the queue before it is sent back as undeliverable.[br]
Specify 0 for mail that should be returned immediately after the first unsuccessful delivery attempt.[/li]
[li]bounce_queue_lifetime (default: 5 days, available with Postfix version 2.1 and later) How long a MAILER-DAEMON message stays in the queue before it is considered undeliverable.
[br] Specify 0 for mail that should be tried only once. [/li]
[li][strong]qmgr message recipient limit (default: 20000)[/li][/strong]
The size of many in-memory queue manager data structures.[br]
Among others, this parameter limits the size of the short-term, in-memory list of "dead" destinations.[br]
Destinations that don't fit the list are not added.[/li]
[/ul]
[i]IMPORTANT: If you increase the frequency of deferred mail delivery attempts, or if you flush the deferred mail queue frequently,
 then you may find that Postfix mail delivery performance actually becomes worse.[/i][br]
 [strong]The symptoms are as follows:[/strong]
 [ul]
[li]The active queue becomes saturated with mail that has delivery problems. New mail enters the active queue only when an old message is deferred.
[br] This is a slow process that usually requires timing out one or more SMTP connections.[/li]
[li]All available Postfix delivery agents become occupied trying to connect to unreachable sites etc.[br]
New mail has to wait until a delivery agent becomes available.[br]
 This is a slow process that usually requires timing out one or more SMTP connections.[/li]
[/ul]When mail is being deferred frequently, fixing the problem is always better than increasing the frequency of delivery attempts.
[br] However, if you can control only the delivery attempt frequency, consider using a dedicated fallback_relay "graveyard" machine for bad destinations,
 so that these destinations do not ruin the performance of normal mail deliveries. 
 [/ul]
</title_postfix_tuning_6_text>
<title_postfix_tuning_7>Tuning the number of Postfix processes</title_postfix_tuning_7>
<title_postfix_tuning_7_text>The "default process limit" configuration parameter gives direct control over how many daemon processes Postfix will run.[br]
As of Postfix 2.0 the default limit is 100 smtp client processes, 100 smtp server processes, and so on.[br]
This may overwhelm systems with little memory, as well as networks with low bandwidth.[br]
You can change the global process limit by specifying a non-default "default process limit".
</title_postfix_tuning_7_text>
<title_postfix_tuning_8>Tuning the number of simultaneous deliveries</title_postfix_tuning_8>
<title_postfix_tuning_8_text>
 Although Postfix can be configured to run 1000 SMTP client processes at the same time, it is rarely desirable that it makes 
 1000 simultaneous connections to the same remote system.[br]
 For this reason, Postfix has safety mechanisms in place to avoid this so-called "thundering herd" problem.[br]
The Postfix queue manager implements the analog of the TCP slow start flow control strategy:
[i]when delivering to a site, send a small number of messages first, then increase the concurrency as long as all goes well; reduce concurrency in the face of congestion.[/i][br]
[ul]The [strong]"initial destination concurrency"[/strong] parameter (default: 5) controls how many messages are initially sent to the same destination before adapting 
delivery concurrency.[br]
Of course, this setting is effective only as long as it does not exceed the process limit and the destination concurrency limit for the specific mail transport channel.[/li]
[li]The [strong]"default destination concurrency limit"[/strong] parameter (default: 20) controls how many messages may be sent to the same destination simultaneously.[br]
 You can override this setting for specific message delivery transports by taking the name of the master.cf entry and appending "_destination_concurrency_limit".[br]
[/ul]
Examples of transport specific concurrency limits are:
[ul]
[li]The [strong]"local destination concurrency limit"[/strong] parameter (default: 2) controls how many messages are delivered simultaneously to the same local recipient.
[br]The recommended limit is low because delivery to the same mailbox must happen sequentially, so massive parallelism is not useful.[br]
Another good reason to limit delivery concurrency to the same recipient:[br] if the recipient has an expensive shell command in her .forward file, 
or if the recipient is a mailing list manager, you don't want to run too many instances of those processes at the same time.[/li]
[li]The default [strong]"smtp destination concurrency limit"[/strong] of 20 seems enough to noticeably load a system without bringing it to its knees.[br]
Be careful when changing this to a much larger number.[/li][/ul]
The above default values of the concurrency limits work well in a broad range of situations.[br]
Knee-jerk changes to these parameters in the face of congestion can actually make problems worse.[br]
Specifically, large destination concurrencies should never be the default.[br]
They should be used only for transports that deliver mail to a small number of high volume domains.[br]
A common situation where high concurrency is called for is on gateways relaying a high volume of mail from between the Internet and an intranet mail environment.[br]
Approximately half the mail (assuming equal volumes inbound and outbound) will be destined for the internal mail hubs.[br]
Since the internal mail hubs will be receiving all external mail exclusively from the gateway, 
it is reasonable to configure the gateway to make greater demands on the capacity of the internal SMTP servers.[br]
The tuning of the inbound concurrency limits need not be trial and error.[br]
 A high volume capable mailhub should be able to easily handle 50 or 100 (rather than the default 20) simultaneous connections, 
 especially if the gateway forwards to multiple MX hosts.[br]
When all MX hosts are up and accepting connections in a timely fashion, throughput will be high.[br]
If any MX host is down and completely unresponsive, the average connection latency rises to at least 1/N * $smtp_connection_timeout, if there are N MX hosts.[br]
This limits throughput to at most the destination concurrency * N / "smtp connection timeout".
[br]For example, with a destination concurrency of 100 and 2 MX hosts, each host will handle up to 50 simultaneous connections.[br]
If one MX host is down and the default SMTP connection timeout is 30s, the throughput limit is [code]100 * 2 / 30 ~= 6[/code] messages per second.[br]
This suggests that high volume destinations with good connectivity and multiple MX hosts need a lower connection timeout, values as low as [code]5s[/code] or even [code]1s[/code]
can be used to prevent congestion when one or more, but not all MX hosts are down.[br]
If necessary, set a higher "transport destination concurrency limit" and a lower "smtp connection timeout" 
(with a "-o" override in master.cf since this parameter has no per-transport name) for the relay transport and any transports dedicated for specific high volume destinations.

<TLS_EXPLAIN>
[b]Secure SMTP over Transport Layer Security[/b][br]SMTP servers and clients normally communicate in the clear over the Internet.[br]
In many cases, this communication goes through one or more router that is not controlled or trusted by either entity.[br]
Such an untrusted router might allow a third party to monitor or alter the communications between the server and client.[br]
Further, there is often a desire for two SMTP agents to be able to authenticate each others` identities.[br]
For example, a secure SMTP server might only allow communications from other SMTP agents it knows, or it might act differently for messages received from an agent it knows than from one it doesn't know.[br]
TLS [TLS], more commonly known as SSL, is a popular mechanism for  enhancing TCP communications with privacy and authentication. 
[br]TLS is in wide use with the HTTP protocol, and is also being used for adding security to many other common protocols that run over TCP.

<WCCP_HOWTO>WCCP is a very common and indeed a good way of doing Interception Caching as 
it adds additional features and intelligence to the traffic redirection process.[br]
 WCCP is a dynamic service in which a cache engine communicates to a router about it's status, 
 and based on that the router decides whether or not to redirect the traffic.[br]
  This means that if your cache becomes unavailable, 
  the router will automatically stop attempting to forward traffic to it and end users will 
  not be affected (and likely not even notice that your cache is out of service).[br]
  For WCCP to work, you firstly need to configure your Squid Cache, and additionally configure the host OS to redirect the HTTP traffic from port 80 to whatever port your Squid box is listening to the traffic on.
  [br]Once you have done this you can then proceed to configure WCCP on your router</WCCP_HOWTO>
