<service_anvil>Session count and request rate control</service_anvil>
<service_anvil_text> The Postfix anvil server maintains statistics about client connection counts or client request rates.[br]
This information can be used to defend against clients that hammer a server with either too many simultaneous sessions,
or with too many successive requests within a configurable time interval.[br]
This server is designed to run under control by the Postfix master server.</service_anvil_text>
<service_bounce>Delivery status reports</service_bounce>
<service_bounce_text>The  bounce daemon maintains per-message log files with delivery status information.[br]
Each log file is named after the queue file that it corresponds to, and is kept in a queue subdirectory named after the service name in
the master.cf file (either bounce, defer or trace).[br]
This program expects to be run from the master process manager</service_bounce_text>
<service_cleanup>Canonicalize and enqueue Postfix message</service_cleanup>
<service_cleanup_text>The cleanup daemon processes inbound mail, inserts it into the incoming mail queue, and informs the queue manager of its arrival</service_cleanup_text>
<service_defer>Delivery status reports (defer)</service_defer>
<service_defer_text> </service_defer_text>
<service_discard>Discard mail delivery agent</service_discard>
<service_discard_text>The  Postfix  discard delivery agent processes delivery requests from the queue manager.[br]
Each request specifies a queue file, a sender address, a domain or host name that is treated as the reason for discarding the mail,
and recipient information.[br]
The reason may be prefixed with an RFC 3463-compatible detail code.[br]
This program expects to be run from the master process manager.[br]
The discard delivery agent pretends to deliver all recipients in the delivery request,
logs the "next-hop" domain or host information as the reason for discarding the mail, updates the queue file and marks  recipients  as
finished or informs the queue manager that delivery should be tried again at a later time.[br]Delivery status reports are sent to the trace daemon as appropriate.
</service_discard_text>
<service_error>Error/retry mail delivery agent</service_error>
<service_error_text>he  Postfix error delivery agent processes delivery requests from the queue manager.[br]
Each request specifies a queue file, a sender address, the reason for non-delivery (specified as the next-hop destination), and recipient information.[br]
The reason may be prefixed with an RFC 3463-compatible detail code; if none is specified a default 4.0.0 or 5.0.0 code is used instead.[br]
This program expects to be run from the master process manager.</service_error_text>
<service_flush>Fast flush server</service_flush>
<service_flush_text>The  flush  server  maintains  a record of deferred mail by destination.[br]
This information is used to improve the performance of the SMTP ETRN request, and of its command-line equivalent, "sendmail -qR" or "postqueue -f".[br]
This program expects to be run from the master(8) process manager.</service_flush_text>
<service_lmtp>LMTP client</service_lmtp>
<service_lmtp_text>
The  Postfix  LMTP  client  implements the LMTP mail delivery protocols.[br]
It processes message delivery requests from the queue manager.[br]
Each request specifies a queue file, a sender address, a domain or host to deliver to, and recipient information.[br]
This program expects to be run from the master process manager</service_lmtp_text>
<service_local>Local mail delivery</service_local>
<service_local_text> The local daemon processes delivery requests from the Postfix queue manager to deliver mail to local recipients.[br]
Each delivery request specifies a queue file, a sender address, a domain or host to deliver to, and one or
more recipients.[br]
This program expects to be run from the master process manager.[br]
The local daemon updates queue files and marks recipients as finished, or it informs the queue manager that delivery should be tried again at a later time.[br]
Delivery status reports are sent to the  bounce ,defer or trace daemon as appropriate.

<service_pickup>Local mail pickup</service_pickup>
<service_pickup_text>The  pickup  daemon  waits  for  hints  that new mail has been dropped into the maildrop directory,
and feeds it into the cleanup daemon.  Ill-formatted files are deleted without notifying the originator.[br]This program expects to be run from the master process manager
</service_pickup_text>
<service_proxymap>Lookup table proxy server</service_proxymap>
<service_proxymap_text>The proxymap server provides read-only table lookup service to Postfix processes.[br]
The purpose of the service is:[br]
[ul][li]To  overcome  chroot restrictions.[br]
For example, a chrooted SMTP server needs access to the system passwd file in order to reject mail for non-existent local addresses,
but it is not practical to maintain a copy of the passwd file in the chroot jail.[/li]
[li]To consolidate the number of open lookup tables by sharing one open table among multiple processes.[br]
For example, making mysql connections from every Postfix daemon process results in "too many connections" errors.[/li]
[/ul]The total number of connections is limited by the number of proxymap server processes.</service_proxymap_text>
<service_qmgr>Queue manager</service_qmgr>
<service_qmgr_text> The  qmgr daemon awaits the arrival of incoming mail and arranges for its delivery via Postfix delivery processes.[br]
The actual mail routing strategy is delegated to the trivial-rewrite daemon.[br]
This program expects to be run from the master process manager</service_qmgr_text>

<service_scache>Shared connection cache server</service_scache>
<service_scache_text>The scache server maintains a shared multi-connection cache.[br]
This information can be used by, for example, Postfix SMTP clients or other Postfix delivery agents.[br]
The connection cache is organized into logical destination names, physical endpoint names, and connections.[br]
As a specific example, logical SMTP destinations specify (transport, domain, port), and physical SMTP endpoints specify (transport, IP address, port).[br]
An SMTP connection may be saved after a successful mail transaction.[br]
In the general case, one logical destination may refer to zero or more physical endpoints, one physical endpoint may be referenced by zero or more logical destinations,
and one endpoint may refer to zero or more connections.</service_scache_text>
<service_showq>List the Postfix mail queue</service_showq>
<service_showq_text>The showq daemon reports the Postfix mail queue status.[br]
It is the program that emulates the sendmail "mailq" command.[br]
The showq daemon can also be run in stand-alone mode by the superuser.[br]
This mode of operation is used to emulate the "mailq" command while the Postfix mail system is down</service_showq_text>
<service_smtp>SMTP client</service_smtp>
<service_smtp_text>The  Postfix  SMTP  client  implements the SMTP mail delivery protocols.[br]
It processes message delivery requests from the queue manager.[br]
Each request specifies a queue file, a sender address, a domain or host to deliver to, and recipient information.[br]
This program expects to be run from the master process manager</service_smtp_text>
<service_tlsmgr>TLS session cache manager</service_tlsmgr>
<service_tlsmgr_text>he tlsmgr manages the Postfix TLS session caches.[br]

<service_verify_text>The verify address verification server maintains a record of what recipient addresses are known to be deliverable or undeliverable.</service_verify_text>
<service_virtual>Virtual domain mail delivery agent</service_virtual>
<service_virtual_text> The  virtual delivery agent is designed for virtual mail hosting services.[br]
Originally based on the Postfix local delivery agent, this agent looks up recipients with map lookups of their full recipient address, instead
of using hard-coded unix password file lookups of the address local part only.[br]
This delivery agent only delivers mail.[br]
Other features such as mail forwarding, out-of-office notifications, etc., must be configured via virtual_alias maps or via similar lookup mechanisms.</service_virtual_text>
<SMTPS_TEXT>This section allows you to enable SMTPs (usually running on 465 port).[br]
If you enable this feature, the master configuration file with smtps service will be added.[br]
If you disable this feature, the master configuration file with smtps service will be deleted.[br]
</SMTPS_TEXT>
<UNIPRIV>Unprivileged</UNIPRIV>
<UNIPRIV_TEXT>(default yes) Whether the service runs with root privileges or as the  owner of
the Postfix system (the owner name is controlled by the mail_owner configuration variablein the main.cf file).</UNIPRIV_TEXT>
<WAKEUP>Wake up time</WAKEUP>
<WAKEUP_TEXT>
(default: 0)   Automatically  wake  up the named service after the specified number of seconds. The wake up is  implemented
by  connecting to the service and sending a wake up request.
A ? at the  end  of  the  wake-up time  field requests that no wake up events be sent before the first time a service is used.
Specify 0 for no automatic wake up.[br]The pickup, qmgr and flush daemons require a wake up timer
</WAKEUP_TEXT>
